                      Warp - Live Video Transport
                           draft-lcurley-warp

Abstract

   This document defines the core behavior for Warp video transport
   protocol.  Warp maps live media to QUIC streams based on the
   underlying media encoding.  Latency is minimized achieved by
   prioritizing the delivery of important media during congestion.

1.  Overview

   Warp is a live video transport protocol that utilizes the [QUIC]
   network protocol.

   The live stream is split into segments (Section 2) at I-frame
   boundaries.  These are fragmented MP4 files as defined in [ISOBMFF].
   Initialization segments contain track metadata while media segments
   contain either video or audio samples.

   QUIC streams (Section 3) are used to transfer messages and segments
   between endpoints.  These streams are prioritized based on the
   contents, such that the most important media is delivered during
   congestion.

   Messages (Section 4) are sent over streams alongside segments.  These
   are used to carry necessary metadata and control messages.

1.1.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Commonly used terms in this document are described below.

   Frame:  An image to be rendered at a specific point in time.

   I-frame:  A frame that does not depend on the contents of other
      frames.

   Group of pictures (GOP):  A I-frame followed by a sequential series
      of dependent frames.

   Group of samples:  A sequential series of audio samples starting at a
      given timestamp.

   Segment:  One or more group of pictures serialized into a container.

   Presentation Timestamp (PTS):  A point in time when video/audio
      should be presented to the viewer.

   Media producer:  An endpoint sending media over the network.

   Media consumer:  An endpoint receiving media over the network.

   Congestion:  Packet loss and queuing caused by degraded or overloaded
      networks.

2.  Segments

   The live stream is split into segments before being transferred over
   the network.  Segments are fragmented MP4 files as defined by
   [ISOBMFF].

   There are two types of segments: initialization and media.

2.1.  Initialization

   Initialization segments contain track metadata but no sample data.







Curley                     Expires 6 June 2022                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    WARP                     December 2021


   Initialization segments MUST consist of a File Type Box ('ftyp')
   followed by a Movie Box ('moov').  This Movie Box consists of Movie
   Header Boxes ('mvhd'), Track Header Boxes ('tkhd'), Track Boxes
   ('trak'), followed by a final Movie Extends Box ('mvex').  These
   boxes MUST NOT contain any samples and MUST have a duration of zero.

   Note that a Common Media Application Format Header [CMAF] meets all
   these requirements.

2.2.  Media

   Media segments contain media samples for a single track.

   Media segments MUST consist of a Segment Type Box ('styp') followed
   by at least one media fragment.  Each media fragment consists of a
   Movie Fragment Box ('moof') followed by a Media Data Box ('mdat').
   The Media Fragment Box MUST contain a Movie Fragment Header Box
   ('mfhd') and Track Box ('trak') with a Track ID ('track_ID') matching
   a Track Box in the initialization segment.

   Note that a Common Media Application Format Segment [CMAF] meets all
   these requirements.

2.2.1.  Video

   Media segments containing video data MUST start with an I-frame.
   Media fragments MAY contain a single frame, minimizing latency at the
   cost of a small increase in segment size.  Video frames MUST be in
   decode order.

2.2.2.  Audio

   Media fragments MAY contain a single group of audio samples,
   minimizing latency at the cost of a small increase in segment size.

3.  Streams

   Warp uses unidirectional QUIC streams to transfer messages and
   segments over the network.  The establishment of the QUIC connection
   is outside the scope of this document.

   An endpoints MAY both send media (producer) and receive media
   (consumer).  This is accomplished by sending messages and segments
   over unidirectional streams.  Streams contain any number of messages
   and segments concatenated together.

Internet-Draft                    WARP                     December 2021


3.1.  Messages

   Messages are used to control playback or carry metadata about
   upcoming segments.

   A Warp Box ('warp') is a top-level MP4 box as defined in [ISOBMFF].
   The contents of this box is a warp message.  See the messages section
   (Section 4) for the encoding and types available.

3.2.  Segments

   Segments are transferred over streams alongside messages.  Each
   segment MUST be preceded by an "init" (Section 4.1) or "media"
   (Section 4.2) message, indicating the type of segment and providing
   additional metadata.

   The media producer SHOULD send each segment as a unique stream to
   avoid head-of-line blocking.  The media producer CAN send multiple
   segments over a single stream, for simplicity, when head-of-line
   blocking is desired.

   A segment is the smallest unit of delivery, as the tail of a segment
   can be safely delayed/dropped without decode errors.  A future
   version of Warp will support layered coding (as another QUIC stream)
   to allow dropping or downscalling frames in the middle of a segment.

3.3.  Prioritization

   Warp utilizes a stream priority scheme to deliver the most important
   content during congestion.

   The media producer assigns a numeric priority to each stream.  This
   is a strict prioritzation scheme, such that any available bandwidth
   is allocated to streams in descending priority order.  QUIC supports
   stream prioritization but does not standardize any mechanisms; see
   Section 2.3 in [QUIC].  The media producer MUST support sending
   priorized streams.  The media producer MAY choose to delay
   retransmitting lower priority streams when possible within QUIC flow
   control limits.

   The media consumer determines how long to wait for a given segment
   (buffer size) before skipping ahead.  The media consumer CAN cancel a
   skipped segment to save bandwidth, or leave it downloading in the
   background (ex. to support rewind).

Internet-Draft                    WARP                     December 2021


   Prioritization allows a single media producer to support multiple
   media consumers with different latency targets.  For example, one
   viewer could have a 1s buffer to minimize latency, another viewer
   could have a 5s buffer to improve quality, while a VOD worker could
   have a 30s buffer to receive all media.

3.3.1.  Live Content

   Live content is encoded and delivered in real-time.  Media delivery
   is blocked on the encoder throughput, except during congestion
   causing limited network throughput.  To best deliver live content:

   *  Audio streams SHOULD be prioritized over video streams.  This
      allows the media consumer to skip video while audio continues
      uninterupted during congestion.

   *  Newer video streams SHOULD be prioritized over older video
      streams.  This allows the media consumer to skip older video
      content during congestion.

   For example, this formula will prioritze audio segments, but only up
   to 3s in the future:

     if is_audio:
       priority = timestamp + 3s
     else:
       priority = timestamp

3.3.2.  Recorded Content

   Recorded content has already been encoded.  Media delivery is blocked
   exclusively on network throughput.

   Warp is primarily designed for live content, but can switch to head-
   of-line blocking by changing stream prioritization.  This is also
   useful for content that should not be skipped over, such as
   advertisements.  To enable head-of-line blocking:

   *  Older streams SHOULD be prioritized over newer streams.

   For example, this formula will prioritize older segments:

     priority = -timestamp

3.4.  Cancelation

   During congestion, this strict prioritization will intentionally
   cause stream starvation for the lowest priority streams.  This
   starvation will last until the network fully recovers, which may be
   indefinite.

   The media consumer SHOULD cancel a stream (via STOP_SENDING frame)
   after it has been skipped to save bandwidth.  The media producer
   SHOULD reset the lowest priority stream (via RESET_STREAM frame) when
   nearing resource limits.  Both of these actions will effectively drop
   the tail of the segment.

3.5.  Middleware

   Media may go through multiple hops and processing steps on the path
   from the broadcaster to player.  The full effectiveness of warp as an
   end-to-end protocol depends on middleware support.

   *  Middleware MUST maintain stream idependence to avoid introducing
      head-of-line blocking.

   *  Middleware SHOULD maintain stream prioritization when traversing
      networks susceptible to congestion.

   *  Middleware MUST forward the "priority" message (Section 4.3) for
      downstream servers.

4.  Messages

   Warp endpoints communicate via messages contained in the top-level
   Warp Box (warp).

   A warp message is JSON object, where the key defines the message type
   and the value depends on the message type.  Unknown messages MUST be
   ignored.

   An endpoint MUST send messages sequentially over a single stream when
   ordering is required.  Messages MAY be combined into a single JSON
   object when ordering is not required.

4.1.  init

   The "init" message indicates that the remainder of the stream
   contains an initialization segment.

   *  The "id" field is incremented by 1 for each unique initialization
      segment.

   {
     init: {
       id: int
     }
   }

4.2.  media

   The "media" message indicates that the remainder of the stream
   contains a media segment.

   *  The "init" field is the id of the cooresponding initialization
      segment.  A decoder MUST block until the coorespending "init"
      message to arrive.

   *  The "timestamp" field indicates the desired presentation timestamp
      in milliseconds at the start of the segment.

   The video consumer uses the "timestamp" field to both handle
   discontinuities and cancel streams without having to parse the
   segment.  It MAY be different from the presentation timestamp in the
   media container, in which case the "timestamp" field takes
   precedence.

   {
     segment: {
       init: int,
       timestamp: int,
     }
   }

4.3.  priority

   The "priority" message informs middleware about the intended priority
   of the current stream.  Any middleware MAY ignore this value but
   SHOULD forward it.

   *  The "strict" field is an integer value, where larger values
      indicate higher priority.  A higher priority stream will always
      use available bandwidth over a lower priority stream.

   {
     priority: {
       strict: int,
     }
   }

4.4.  Extensions

   Custom messages MUST contain a hyphen, typically part of a prefix.

   For example: "twitch-load" would contain identification required to
   start playback of a Twitch stream.
