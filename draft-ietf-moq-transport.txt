                       Media over QUIC Transport
                    draft-ietf-moq-transport-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the core behavior for Media over QUIC Transport
   (MOQT), a media transport protocol designed to operate over QUIC and
   WebTransport, which have similar functionality.  MOQT allows a
   producer of media to publish data and have it consumed via
   subscription by a multiplicity of endpoints.  It supports
   intermediate content distribution networks and is designed for high
   scale and low latency distribution.

1.  Introduction

   Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) is a protocol that is optimized for
   the QUIC protocol [QUIC], either directly or via WebTransport
   [WebTransport], for the dissemination of media.  MOQT utilizes a
   publish/subscribe workflow in which producers of media publish data
   in response to subscription requests from a multiplicity of
   endpoints.  MOQT supports wide range of use-cases with different
   resiliency and latency (live, interactive) needs without compromising
   the scalability and cost effectiveness associated with content
   delivery networks.

   MOQT is a generic protocol is designed to work in concert with
   multiple MoQ Streaming Formats.  These MoQ Streaming Formats define
   how content is encoded, packaged, and mapped to MOQT objects, along
   with policies for discovery and subscription.

   *  Section 2 describes the object model employed by MOQT.

   *  Section 3 covers aspects of setting up a MOQT session.

   *  Section 4 covers protocol considerations on prioritization schemes
      and congestion response overall.

   *  Section 5 covers behavior at the relay entities.

   *  Section 6 covers how messages are encoded on the wire.

1.1.  Motivation

   The development of MOQT is driven by goals in a number of areas -
   specifically latency, the robustness of QUIC, workflow efficiency and
   relay support.

1.1.1.  Latency

   HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) has been successful at achieving scale
   although often at the cost of latency.  Latency is necessary to
   correct for variable network throughput.  Ideally live content is
   consumed at the same bitrate it is produced.  End-to-end latency
   would be fixed and only subject to encoding and transmission delays.
   Unfortunately, networks have variable throughput, primarily due to
   congestion.  Attempting to deliver content encoded at a higher
   bitrate than the network can support causes queuing along the path
   from producer to consumer.  The speed at which a protocol can detect
   and respond to queuing determines the overall latency.  TCP-based
   protocols are simple but are slow to detect congestion and suffer
   from head-of-line blocking.  Protocols utilizing UDP directly can
   avoid queuing, but the application is then responsible for the
   complexity of fragmentation, congestion control, retransmissions,
   receiver feedback, reassembly, and more.  One goal of MOQT is to
   achieve the best of both these worlds: leverage the features of QUIC
   to create a simple yet flexible low latency protocol that can rapidly
   detect and respond to congestion.

1.1.2.  Leveraging QUIC

   The parallel nature of QUIC streams can provide improvements in the
   face of loss.  A goal of MOQT is to design a streaming protocol to
   leverage the transmission benefits afforded by parallel QUIC streams
   as well exercising options for flexible loss recovery.  Applying
   [QUIC] to HAS via HTTP/3 has not yet yielded generalized improvements
   in throughput.  One reason for this is that sending segments down a
   single QUIC stream still allows head-of-line blocking to occur.

1.1.3.  Universal

   Internet delivered media today has protocols optimized for ingest and
   separate protocols optimized for distribution.  This protocol switch
   in the distribution chain necessitates intermediary origins which re-
   package the media content.  While specialization can have its
   benefits, there are gains in efficiency to be had in not having to
   re-package content.  A goal of MOQT is to develop a single protocol
   which can be used for transmission from contribution to distribution.
   A related goal is the ability to support existing encoding and
   packaging schemas, both for backwards compatibility and for
   interoperability with the established content preparation ecosystem.

1.1.4.  Relays

   An integral feature of a protocol being successful is its ability to
   deliver media at scale.  Greatest scale is achieved when third-party
   networks, independent of both the publisher and subscriber, can be
   leveraged to relay the content.  These relays must cache content for
   distribution efficiency while simultaneously routing content and
   deterministically responding to congestion in a multi-tenant network.
   A goal of MOQT is to treat relays as first-class citizens of the
   protocol and ensure that objects are structured such that information
   necessary for distribution is available to relays while the media
   content itself remains opaque and private.

1.2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Client:  The party initiating a MoQ transport session.

   Server:  The party accepting an incoming transport session.

   Endpoint:  A Client or Server.

   Producer:  An endpoint sending media over the network.

   Consumer:  An endpoint receiving media over the network.

   Transport session:  A raw QUIC connection or a WebTransport session.

   Congestion:  Packet loss and queuing caused by degraded or overloaded
      networks.

   Group:  A temporal sequence of objects.  A group represents a join
      point in a track.  See (Section 2.2).

   Object:  An object is an addressable unit whose payload is a sequence
      of bytes.  Objects form the base element in the MOQT model.  See
      (Section 2.1).

   Track:  An encoded bitstream.  Tracks contain a sequential series of
      one or more groups and are the subscribable entity with MOQT.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   This document uses the conventions detailed in ([RFC9000],
   Section 1.3) when describing the binary encoding.

   As a quick reference, the following list provides a non normative
   summary of the parts of RFC9000 field syntax that are used in this
   specification.

   x (L):  Indicates that x is L bits long

   x (i):  Indicates that x holds an integer value using the variable-
      length encoding as described in ([RFC9000], Section 16)

   x (..):  Indicates that x can be any length including zero bits long.
      Values in this format always end on a byte boundary.

   [x (L)]:  Indicates that x is optional and has a length of L

   x (L) ...:  Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times and that
      each instance has a length of L

   This document extends the RFC9000 syntax and with the additional
   field types:

   x (b):  Indicates that x consists of a variable length integer
      encoding as described in ([RFC9000], Section 16), followed by that
      many bytes of binary data

   x (f):  Indicates that x is a flag and is encoded as a single byte
      with the value 0 or 1.  A value of 0 indicates the flag is false
      or off, while a value of 1 indicates the flag is true or on.  Any
      other value is a protocol error and SHOULD terminate the session
      with a Protocol Violation (Section 3.5).

   To reduce unnecessary use of bandwidth, variable length integers
   SHOULD be encoded using the least number of bytes possible to
   represent the required value.

2.  Object Model

   MOQT has a hierarchical object model for data, comprised of objects,
   groups and tracks.

2.1.  Objects

   The basic data element of MOQT is an object.  An object is an
   addressable unit whose payload is a sequence of bytes.  All objects
   belong to a group, indicating ordering and potential dependencies.
   Section 2.2 An object is uniquely identified by its track namespace,
   track name, group ID, and object ID, and must be an identical
   sequence of bytes regardless of how or where it is retrieved.  An
   Object can become unavailable, but it's contents MUST NOT change over
   time.

   Objects are comprised of two parts: metadata and a payload.  The
   metadata is never encrypted and is always visible to relays.  The
   payload portion may be encrypted, in which case it is only visible to
   the producer and consumer.  The application is solely responsible for
   the content of the object payload.  This includes the underlying
   encoding, compression, any end-to-end encryption, or authentication.
   A relay MUST NOT combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.

2.2.  Groups

   A group is a collection of objects and is a sub-unit of a track
   (Section 2.3).  Objects within a group SHOULD NOT depend on objects
   in other groups.  A group behaves as a join point for subscriptions.
   A new subscriber might not want to receive the entire track, and may
   instead opt to receive only the latest group(s).  The sender then
   selectively transmits objects based on their group membership.

2.3.  Track

   A track is a sequence of groups (Section 2.2).  It is the entity
   against which a consumer issues a subscription request.  A subscriber
   can request to receive individual tracks starting at a group
   boundary, including any new objects pushed by the producer while the
   track is active.

2.3.1.  Track Naming and Scopes

   In MOQT, every track has a track name and a track namespace
   associated with it.  A track name identifies an individual track
   within the namespace.

   A MOQT scope is a set of servers (as identified by their connection
   URIs) for which the tuple of Track Name and Track Namespace are
   guaranteed to be unique and identify a specific track.  It is up to
   the application using MOQT to define how broad or narrow the scope
   is.  An application that deals with connections between devices on a
   local network may limit the scope to a single connection; by
   contrast, an application that uses multiple CDNs to serve media may
   require the scope to include all of those CDNs.

   Because the tuple of Track Namespace and Track Name are unique within
   an MOQT scope, they can be used as a cache key.  MOQT does not
   provide any in-band content negotiation methods similar to the ones
   defined by HTTP ([RFC9110], Section 10); if, at a given moment in
   time, two tracks within the same scope contain different data, they
   have to have different names and/or namespaces.

   In this specification, both the Track Namespace and the Track Name
   are not constrained to a specific encoding.  They carry a sequence of
   bytes and comparison between two Track Namespaces or Track Names is
   done by exact comparison of the bytes.  Specifications that use MoQ
   Transport may constrain the information in these fields, for example
   by restricting them to UTF-8.  Any specification that does needs to
   specify the canonicalization into the bytes in the Track Namespace or
   Track Name such that exact comparison works.

2.3.2.  Connection URL

   Each track MAY have one or more associated connection URLs specifying
   network hosts through which a track may be accessed.  The syntax of
   the Connection URL and the associated connection setup procedures are
   specific to the underlying transport protocol usage Section 3.

3.  Sessions

3.1.  Session establishment

   This document defines a protocol that can be used interchangeably
   both over a QUIC connection directly [QUIC], and over WebTransport
   [WebTransport].  Both provide streams and datagrams with similar
   semantics (see [I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview], Section 4); thus, the
   main difference lies in how the servers are identified and how the
   connection is established.  When using QUIC, datagrams MUST be
   supported via the [QUIC-DATAGRAM] extension, which is already a
   requirement for WebTransport over HTTP/3.

   There is no definition of the protocol over other transports, such as
   TCP, and applications using MoQ might need to fallback to another
   protocol when QUIC or WebTransport aren't available.

3.1.1.  WebTransport

   A MOQT server that is accessible via WebTransport can be identified
   using an HTTPS URI ([RFC9110], Section 4.2.2).  A MOQT session can be
   established by sending an extended CONNECT request to the host and
   the path indicated by the URI, as described in [WebTransport],
   Section 3.

3.1.2.  QUIC

   A MOQT server that is accessible via native QUIC can be identified by
   a URI with a "moq" scheme.  The "moq" URI scheme is defined as
   follows, using definitions from [RFC3986]:

   moq-URI = "moqt" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The authority portion MUST NOT contain a non-empty host portion.  The
   moq URI scheme supports the /.well-known/ path prefix defined in
   [RFC8615].

   This protocol does not specify any semantics on the path-abempty and
   query portions of the URI.  The contents of those are left up to the
   application.

   The client can establish a connection to a MoQ server identified by a
   given URI by setting up a QUIC connection to the host and port
   identified by the authority section of the URI.  The path-abempty and
   query portions of the URI are communicated to the server using the
   PATH parameter (Section 6.2.2.2) which is sent in the CLIENT_SETUP
   message at the start of the session.  The ALPN value [RFC7301] used
   by the protocol is moq-00.

3.2.  Version and Extension Negotiation

   Endpoints use the exchange of Setup messages to negotiate the MOQT
   version and any extensions to use.

   The client indicates the MOQT versions it supports in the
   CLIENT_SETUP message (see Section 6.2).  It also includes the union
   of all Setup Parameters Section 6.2.2 required for a handshake by any
   of those versions.

   Within any MOQT version, clients request the use of extensions by
   adding Setup parameters corresponding to that extension.  No
   extensions are defined in this document.

   The server replies with a SERVER_SETUP message that indicates the
   chosen version, includes all parameters required for a handshake in
   that version, and parameters for every extension requested by the
   client that it supports.

   New versions of MOQT MUST specify which existing extensions can be
   used with that version.  New extensions MUST specify the existing
   versions with which they can be used.

   If a given parameter carries the same information in multiple
   versions, but might have different optimal values in those versions,
   there SHOULD be separate Setup parameters for that information in
   each version.

3.3.  Session initialization

   The first stream opened is a client-initiated bidirectional control
   stream where the peers exchange Setup messages (Section 6.2).  All
   messages defined in this draft except OBJECT and OBJECT_WITH_LENGTH
   are sent on the control stream after the Setup message.  Control
   messages MUST NOT be sent on any other stream, and a peer receiving a
   control message on a different stream closes the session as a
   'Protocol Violation'.  Objects MUST NOT be sent on the control
   stream, and a peer receiving an Object on the control stream closes
   the session as a 'Protocol Violation'.

   This draft only specifies a single use of bidirectional streams.
   Objects are sent on unidirectional streams.  Because there are no
   other uses of bidirectional streams, a peer MAY currently close the
   session as a 'Protocol Violation' if it receives a second
   bidirectional stream.

   The control stream MUST NOT be abruptly closed at the underlying
   transport layer.  Doing so results in the session being closed as a
   'Protocol Violation'.

3.4.  Stream Cancellation

   Streams aside from the control stream MAY be canceled due to
   congestion or other reasons by either the sender or receiver.  Early
   termination of a stream does not affect the MoQ application state,
   and therefore has no effect on outstanding subscriptions.

3.5.  Termination

   The transport session can be terminated at any point.  When native
   QUIC is used, the session is closed using the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
   ([QUIC], Section 19.19).  When WebTransport is used, the session is
   closed using the CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule ([WebTransport],
   Section 5).

   The application MAY use any error message and SHOULD use a relevant
   code, as defined below:

                   +======+===========================+
                   | Code | Reason                    |
                   +======+===========================+
                   |  0x0 | No Error                  |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   |  0x1 | Internal Error            |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   |  0x2 | Unauthorized              |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   |  0x3 | Protocol Violation        |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   |  0x4 | Duplicate Track Alias     |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   |  0x5 | Parameter Length Mismatch |
                   +------+---------------------------+
                   | 0x10 | GOAWAY Timeout            |
                   +------+---------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   *  No Error: The session is being terminated without an error.

   *  Internal Error: An implementation specific error occurred.

   *  Unauthorized: The endpoint breached an agreement, which MAY have
      been pre-negotiated by the application.

   *  Protocol Violation: The remote endpoint performed an action that
      was disallowed by the specification.

   *  Duplicate Track Alias: The endpoint attempted to use a Track Alias
      that was already in use.

   *  GOAWAY Timeout: The session was closed because the client took too
      long to close the session in response to a GOAWAY (Section 6.3)
      message.  See session migration (Section 3.6).

3.6.  Migration

   MoqTransport requires a long-lived and stateful session.  However, a
   service provider needs the ability to shutdown/restart a server
   without waiting for all sessions to drain naturally, as that can take
   days for long-form media.  MoqTransport avoids this via the GOAWAY
   message (Section 6.3).

   The server sends a GOAWAY message, signaling that the client should
   establish a new session and migrate any active subscriptions.  The
   GOAWAY message may contain a new URI for the new session, otherwise
   the current URI is reused.  The server SHOULD terminate the session
   with 'GOAWAY Timeout' after a sufficient timeout if there are still
   open subscriptions on a connection.

   The GOAWAY message does not immediately impact subscription state.  A
   subscriber SHOULD individually UNSUBSCRIBE for each existing
   subscription, while a publisher MAY reject new SUBSCRIBEs while in
   the draining state.  When the server is a subscriber, it SHOULD send
   a GOAWAY message prior to any UNSUBSCRIBE messages.

   After the client receives a GOAWAY, it's RECOMMENDED that the client
   waits until there are no more active subscriptions before closing the
   session with NO_ERROR.  Ideally this is transparent to the
   application using MOQT, which involves establishing a new session in
   the background and migrating active subscriptions and announcements.
   The client can choose to delay closing the session if it expects more
   OBJECTs to be delivered.  The server closes the session with a
   'GOAWAY Timeout' if the client doesn't close the session quickly
   enough.

4.  Prioritization and Congestion Response

   TODO: This is a placeholder section to capture details on how the
   MOQT protocol deals with prioritization and congestion overall.

   This section is expected to cover details on:

   *  Prioritization Schemes.

   *  Congestion Algorithms and impacts.

   *  Mapping considerations for one object per stream vs multiple
      objects per stream.

   *  Considerations for merging multiple streams across domains onto
      single connection and interactions with specific prioritization
      schemes.

4.1.  Order Priorities and Options

   At the point of this writing, the working group has not reached
   consensus on several important goals, such as:

   *  Ensuring that objects are delivered in the order intended by the
      emitter

   *  Allowing nodes and relays to skip or delay some objects to deal
      with congestion

   *  Ensuring that emitters can accurately predict the behavior of
      relays

   *  Ensuring that when relays have to skip and delay objects belonging
      to different tracks that they do it in a predictable way if tracks
      are explicitly coordinated and in a fair way if they are not.

   The working group has been considering two alternatives: marking
   objects belonging to a track with an explicit "send order"; and,
   defining algorithms combining tracks, priorities and object order
   within a group.  The two proposals are listed in Section 4.1.1 and
   Section 4.1.2.  We expect further work before a consensus is reached.

4.1.1.  Proposal - Send Order

   Media is produced with an intended order, both in terms of when media
   should be presented (PTS) and when media should be decoded (DTS).  As
   stated in the introduction, the network is unable to maintain this
   ordering during congestion without increasing latency.

   The encoder determines how to behave during congestion by assigning
   each object a numeric send order.  The send order SHOULD be followed
   when possible, to ensure that the most important media is delivered
   when throughput is limited.  Note that the contents within each
   object are still delivered in order; this send order only applies to
   the ordering between objects.

   A sender MUST send each object over a dedicated stream.  The library
   should support prioritization (Section 4) such that streams are
   transmitted in send order.

   A receiver MUST NOT assume that objects will be received in send
   order, for the following reasons:

   *  Newly encoded objects can have a smaller send order than
      outstanding objects.

   *  Packet loss or flow control can delay the send of individual
      streams.

   *  The sender might not support stream prioritization.

   TODO: Refer to Congestion Response and Prioritization Section for
   further details on various proposals.

4.1.2.  Proposal - Ordering by Priorities

   Media is produced as a set of layers, such as for example low
   definition and high definition, or low frame rate and high frame
   rate.  Each object belonging to a track and a group has two
   attributes: the object-id, and the priority (or layer).

   When nodes or relays have to choose which object to send next, they
   apply the following rules:

   *  within the same group, objects with a lower priority number (e.g.
      P1) are always sent before objects with a numerically greater
      priority number (e.g., P2)

   *  within the same group, and the same priority level, objects with a
      lower object-id are always sent before objects with a higher
      object-id.

   *  objects from later groups are normally always sent before objects
      of previous groups.

   The latter rule is generally agreed as a way to ensure freshness, and
   to recover quickly if queues and delays accumulate during a
   congestion period.  However, there may be cases when finishing the
   transmission of an ongoing group results in better user experience
   than strict adherence to the freshness rule.  We expect that that the
   working group will eventually reach consensus and define meta data
   that controls this behavior.

   There have been proposals to allow emitters to coordinate the
   allocation of layer priorities across multiple coordinated tracks.
   At this point, these proposals have not reached consensus.

5.  Relays

   Relays are leveraged to enable distribution scale in the MoQ
   architecture.  Relays can be used to form an overlay delivery
   network, similar in functionality to Content Delivery Networks
   (CDNs).  Additionally, relays serve as policy enforcement points by
   validating subscribe and publish requests at the edge of a network.

5.1.  Subscriber Interactions

   Subscribers interact with the Relays by sending a SUBSCRIBE
   (Section 6.4) control message for the tracks of interest.  Relays
   MUST ensure subscribers are authorized to access the content
   associated with the track.  The authorization information can be part
   of subscription request itself or part of the encompassing session.
   The specifics of how a relay authorizes a user are outside the scope
   of this specification.

   The subscriber making the subscribe request is notified of the result
   of the subscription, via SUBSCRIBE_OK (Section 6.12) or the
   SUBSCRIBE_ERROR Section 6.13 control message.  The entity receiving
   the SUBSCRIBE MUST send only a single response to a given SUBSCRIBE
   of either SUBSCRIBE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR.

   For successful subscriptions, the publisher maintains a list of
   subscribers for each track.  Each new OBJECT belonging to the track
   within the subscription range is forwarded to each active subscriber,
   dependent on the congestion response.  A subscription remains active
   until the publisher of the track terminates the track with a
   SUBSCRIBE_DONE (see Section 6.14).

   Objects MUST NOT be sent for unsuccessful subscriptions, and if a
   subscriber receives a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR after receiving objects, it
   MUST close the session with a 'Protocol Violation'.

   A relay MUST not reorder or drop objects received on a multi-object
   stream when forwarding to subscribers, unless it has application
   specific information.

   Relays MAY aggregate authorized subscriptions for a given track when
   multiple subscribers request the same track.  Subscription
   aggregation allows relays to make only a single forward subscription
   for the track.  The published content received from the forward
   subscription request is cached and shared among the pending
   subscribers.

   The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in SUBSCRIBE_ERROR,
   as defined below:

                       +======+===================+
                       | Code | Reason            |
                       +======+===================+
                       |  0x0 | Internal Error    |
                       +------+-------------------+
                       |  0x1 | Invalid Range     |
                       +------+-------------------+
                       |  0x2 | Retry Track Alias |
                       +------+-------------------+

                                 Table 2

   The application SHOULD use a relevant status code in SUBSCRIBE_DONE,
   as defined below:

                       +======+====================+
                       | Code | Reason             |
                       +======+====================+
                       |  0x0 | Unsubscribed       |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x1 | Internal Error     |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x2 | Unauthorized       |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x3 | Track Ended        |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x4 | Subscription Ended |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x5 | Going Away         |
                       +------+--------------------+
                       |  0x6 | Expired            |
                       +------+--------------------+

                                  Table 3

5.2.  Publisher Interactions

   Publishing through the relay starts with publisher sending ANNOUNCE
   control message with a Track Namespace (Section 2.3).

   Relays MUST ensure that publishers are authorized by:

   *  Verifying that the publisher is authorized to publish the content
      associated with the set of tracks whose Track Namespace matches
      the announced namespace.  Specifics of where the authorization
      happens, either at the relays or forwarded for further processing,
      depends on the way the relay is managed and is application
      specific (typically based on prior business agreement).

   Relays respond with an ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR control message
   providing the result of announcement.  The entity receiving the
   ANNOUNCE MUST send only a single response to a given ANNOUNCE of
   either ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR.  When a publisher wants to stop
   new subscriptions for an announced namespace it sends an UNANNOUNCE.
   A subscriber indicates it will no longer route subscriptions for a
   namespace it previously responded ANNOUNCE_OK to by sending an
   ANNOUNCE_CANCEL.

   A relay manages sessions from multiple publishers and subscribers,
   connecting them based on the track namespace.  This MUST use an exact
   match on track namespace unless otherwise negotiated by the
   application.  For example, a SUBSCRIBE namespace=foobar message will
   be forwarded to the session that sent ANNOUNCE namespace=foobar.

   OBJECT message headers carry a short hop-by-hop Track Alias that maps
   to the Full Track Name (see Section 6.12).  Relays use the Track
   Alias of an incoming OBJECT message to identify its track and find
   the active subscribers for that track.  Relays MUST NOT depend on
   OBJECT payload content for making forwarding decisions and MUST only
   depend on the fields, such as priority order and other metadata
   properties in the OBJECT message header.  Unless determined by
   congestion response, Relays MUST forward the OBJECT message to the
   matching subscribers.

5.3.  Congestion Response at Relays

   TODO: Refer to Section 4.  Add details to describe relay behavior
   when merging or splitting streams and interactions with congestion
   response.

5.4.  Relay Object Handling

   MOQT encodes the delivery information for a stream via OBJECT headers
   (Section 6.11).  A relay MUST NOT modify Object properties when
   forwarding.

   A relay MUST treat the object payload as opaque.  A relay MUST NOT
   combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.  A relay SHOULD
   prioritize streams (Section 4) based on the send order/priority.

   A sender SHOULD begin sending incomplete objects when available to
   avoid incurring additional latency.

   A relay that reads from a stream and writes to stream in order will
   introduce head-of-line blocking.  Packet loss will cause stream data
   to be buffered in the library, awaiting in order delivery, which will
   increase latency over additional hops.  To mitigate this, a relay
   SHOULD read and write stream data out of order subject to flow
   control limits.  See section 2.2 in [QUIC].

6.  Messages

   Unidirectional streams and datagrams contain Objects and all other
   messages are sent on a bidirectional stream.

   An endpoint that receives an unknown message type MUST close the
   session.

   MOQT Message {
     Message Type (i),
     Message Payload (..),
   }

                           Figure 1: MOQT Message

                                  Table 4

6.1.  Parameters

   Some messages include a Parameters field that encode optional message
   elements.  They contain a type, length, and value.

   Senders MUST NOT repeat the same parameter type in a message.
   Receivers SHOULD check that there are no duplicate parameters and
   close the session as a 'Protocol Violation' if found.

   Receivers ignore unrecognized parameters.

   The format of Parameters is as follows:

   Parameter {
     Parameter Type (i),
     Parameter Length (i),
     Parameter Value (..),
   }

                          Figure 2: MOQT Parameter

   Parameter Type is an integer that indicates the semantic meaning of
   the parameter.  Setup message parameters use a namespace that is
   constant across all MoQ Transport versions.  All other messages use a
   version-specific namespace.  For example, the integer '1' can refer
   to different parameters for Setup messages and for all other message
   types.

   SETUP message parameter types are defined in Section 6.2.2.  Version-
   specific parameter types are defined in Section 6.1.1.

   The Parameter Length field of the String Parameter encodes the length
   of the Parameter Value field in bytes.

   Each parameter description will indicate the data type in the
   Parameter Value field.  If a receiver understands a parameter type,
   and the parameter length implied by that type does not match the
   Parameter Length field, the receiver MUST terminate the session with
   error code 'Parameter Length Mismatch'.

6.1.1.  Version Specific Parameters

   Each version-specific parameter definition indicates the message
   types in which it can appear.  If it appears in some other type of
   message, it MUST be ignored.  Note that since Setup parameters use a
   separate namespace, it is impossible for these parameters to appear
   in Setup messages.

6.1.1.1.  AUTHORIZATION INFO Parameter

   AUTHORIZATION INFO parameter (key 0x02) identifies a track's
   authorization information in a SUBSCRIBE or ANNOUNCE message.  This
   parameter is populated for cases where the authorization is required
   at the track level.  The value is an ASCII string.

6.2.  CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP

   The CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP messages are the first messages
   exchanged by the client and the server; they allows the peers to
   establish the mutually supported version and agree on the initial
   configuration before any objects are exchanged.  It is a sequence of
   key-value pairs called Setup parameters; the semantics and format of
   which can vary based on whether the client or server is sending.  To
   ensure future extensibility of MOQT, the peers MUST ignore unknown
   setup parameters.  TODO: describe GREASE for those.

   The wire format of the Setup messages are as follows:

   CLIENT_SETUP Message Payload {
     Number of Supported Versions (i),
     Supported Version (i) ...,
     Number of Parameters (i) ...,
     Setup Parameters (..) ...,
   }

   SERVER_SETUP Message Payload {
     Selected Version (i),
     Number of Parameters (i) ...,
     Setup Parameters (..) ...,
   }

                       Figure 3: MOQT Setup Messages

   The available versions and Setup parameters are detailed in the next
   sections.

6.2.1.  Versions

   MoQ Transport versions are a 32-bit unsigned integer, encoded as a
   varint.  This version of the specification is identified by the
   number 0x00000001.  Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the
   version number cleared are reserved for use in future IETF consensus
   documents.

   The client offers the list of the protocol versions it supports; the
   server MUST reply with one of the versions offered by the client.  If
   the server does not support any of the versions offered by the
   client, or the client receives a server version that it did not
   offer, the corresponding peer MUST close the session.

   [[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before
   publication.]]

   The version number for the final version of this specification
   (0x00000001), is reserved for the version of the protocol that is
   published as an RFC.  Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts
   are created by adding the draft number to 0xff000000.  For example,
   draft-ietf-moq-transport-13 would be identified as 0xff00000D.

6.2.2.  Setup Parameters

6.2.2.1.  ROLE parameter

   The ROLE parameter (key 0x00) allows each endpoint to independently
   specify what functionality they support for the session.  It has
   three possible values, which are of type varint:

   0x01: Publisher  The endpoint can process subscriptions and send
      objects, but not subscribe.  The endpoint MUST NOT send a
      SUBSCRIBE message and an ANNOUNCE MUST NOT be sent to it.

   0x02: Subscriber  The endpoint can send subscriptions and receive
      objects, but not publish.  The endpoint MUST NOT send an ANNOUNCE
      message and a SUBSCRIBE MUST NOT be sent to it.

   0x03: PubSub  The endpoint can act as a publisher or subscriber, and
      can send or process any message type.

   Both endpoints MUST send a ROLE parameter with one of the three
   values specified above.  Both endpoints MUST close the session if the
   ROLE parameter is missing or is not one of the three above-specified
   values.

6.2.2.2.  PATH parameter

   The PATH parameter (key 0x01) allows the client to specify the path
   of the MoQ URI when using native QUIC ([QUIC]).  It MUST NOT be used
   by the server, or when WebTransport is used.  If the peer receives a
   PATH parameter from the server, or when WebTransport is used, it MUST
   close the connection.  It follows the URI formatting rules [RFC3986].

   When connecting to a server using a URI with the "moq" scheme, the
   client MUST set the PATH parameter to the path-abempty portion of the
   URI; if query is present, the client MUST concatenate ?, followed by
   the query portion of the URI to the parameter.

6.3.  GOAWAY

   The server sends a GOAWAY message to initiate session migration
   (Section 3.6) with an optional URI.

   The server MUST terminate the session with a Protocol Violation
   (Section 3.5) if it receives a GOAWAY message.  The client MUST
   terminate the session with a Protocol Violation (Section 3.5) if it
   receives multiple GOAWAY messages.

   GOAWAY Message {
     New Session URI (b)
   }

                       Figure 4: MOQT GOAWAY Message

   *  New Session URI: The client MUST use this URI for the new session
      if provided.  If the URI is zero bytes long, the current URI is
      reused instead.  The new session URI SHOULD use the same scheme as
      the current URL to ensure compatibility.

6.4.  SUBSCRIBE

6.4.1.  Filter Types

   The subscriber specifies a filter on the subscription to allow the
   publisher to identify which objects need to be delivered.

   There are 4 types of filters:

   Latest Group (0x1) : Specifies an open-ended subscription with
   objects from the beginning of the current group.

   Latest Object (0x2): Specifies an open-ended subscription beginning
   from the current object of the current group.

   AbsoluteStart (0x3): Specifies an open-ended subscription beginning
   from the object identified in the StartGroup and StartObject fields.

   AbsoluteRange (0x4): Specifies a closed subscription starting at
   StartObject in StartGroup and ending at EndObject in EndGroup.  The
   start and end of the range are inclusive.  EndGroup and EndObject
   MUST specify the same or a later object than StartGroup and
   StartObject.

   A filter type other than the above MUST be treated as error.

6.4.2.  SUBSCRIBE Format

   A receiver issues a SUBSCRIBE to a publisher to request a track.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Alias (i),
     Track Namespace (b),
     Track Name (b),
     Filter Type (i),
     [StartGroup (i),
      StartObject (i)],
     [EndGroup (i),
      EndObject (i)],
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Track Request Parameters (..) ...
   }

                      Figure 5: MOQT SUBSCRIBE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The subscription identifier that is unique within
      the session.  Subscribe ID is a monotonically increasing variable
      length integer which MUST not be reused within a session.
      Subscribe ID is used by subscribers and the publishers to identify
      a given subscription.  Subscribers specify the Subscribe ID and it
      is included in the corresponding SUBSCRIBE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
      messages.

   *  Track Alias: A session specific identifier for the track.
      Messages that reference a track, such as OBJECT (Section 6.11),
      reference this Track Alias instead of the Track Name and Track
      Namespace to reduce overhead.  If the Track Alias is already in
      use, the publisher MUST close the session with a Duplicate Track
      Alias error (Section 3.5).

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined
      in (Section 2.3.1).

   *  Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in
      (Section 2.3.1).

   *  Filter Type: Identifies the type of filter, which also indicates
      whether the StartGroup/StartObject and EndGroup/EndObject fields
      will be present.  See (Section 6.4.1).

   *  StartGroup: The start Group ID.  Only present for "AbsoluteStart"
      and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

   *  StartObject: The start Object ID.  Only present for
      "AbsoluteStart" and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

   *  EndGroup: The end Group ID.  Only present for the "AbsoluteRange"
      filter type.

   *  EndObject: The end Object ID, plus 1.  A value of 0 means the
      entire group is requested.  Only present for the "AbsoluteRange"
      filter type.

   *  Track Request Parameters: The parameters are defined in
      Section 6.1.1

   On successful subscription, the publisher MUST reply with a
   SUBSCRIBE_OK, allowing the subscriber to determine the start group/
   object when not explicitly specified and the publisher SHOULD start
   delivering objects.

   If a publisher cannot satisfy the requested start or end for the
   subscription it MAY send a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR with code 'Invalid Range'.
   A publisher MUST NOT send objects from outside the requested start
   and end.

6.5.  SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE

   A receiver issues a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE to a publisher to request a
   change to a prior subscription.  Subscriptions can only become more
   narrower, not wider, because an attempt to widen a subscription could
   fail.  If Objects before the start or after the end of the current
   subscription are needed, a separate subscription can be made.  The
   start Object MUST NOT decrease and when it increases, there is no
   guarantee that a publisher will not have already sent Objects before
   the new start Object.  The end Object MUST NOT increase and when it
   decreases, there is no guarantee that a publisher will not have
   already sent Objects after the new end Object.

   Unlike a new subscription, SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE can not cause an Object
   to be delivered multiple times.  Like SUBSCRIBE, EndGroup and
   EndObject MUST specify the same or a later object than StartGroup and
   StartObject.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     StartGroup (i),
     StartObject (i),
     EndGroup (i),
     EndObject (i),
     Number of Parameters (i),

   }

                  Figure 6: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The subscription identifier that is unique within
      the session.  This MUST match an existing Subscribe ID.

   *  StartGroup: The start Group ID.

   *  StartObject: The start Object ID.

   *  EndGroup: The end Group ID, plus 1.  A value of 0 means the
      subscription is open-ended.

   *  EndObject: The end Object ID, plus 1.  A value of 0 means the
      entire group is requested.

   *  Track Request Parameters: The parameters are defined in
      Section 6.1.1

6.6.  UNSUBSCRIBE

   A subscriber issues a UNSUBSCRIBE message to a publisher indicating
   it is no longer interested in receiving media for the specified track
   and Objects should stop being sent as soon as possible.  The
   publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_DONE to acknowledge the unsubscribe was
   successful and indicate the final Object.

   The format of UNSUBSCRIBE is as follows:

   UNSUBSCRIBE Message {
     Subscribe ID (i)
   }

                     Figure 7: MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

6.7.  ANNOUNCE_OK

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_OK control message to acknowledge
   the successful authorization and acceptance of an ANNOUNCE message.

   ANNOUNCE_OK
   {
     Track Namespace (b),
   }

                     Figure 8: MOQT ANNOUNCE_OK Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the track namespace in the ANNOUNCE
      message for which this response is provided.

6.8.  ANNOUNCE_ERROR

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_ERROR control message for tracks
   that failed authorization.

   ANNOUNCE_ERROR
   {
     Track Namespace (b),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase (b),
   }

                   Figure 9: MOQT ANNOUNCE_ERROR Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the track namespace in the ANNOUNCE
      message for which this response is provided.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for announcement
      failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for announcement error.

6.9.  ANNOUNCE_CANCEL

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL control message to indicate
   it will stop sending new subscriptions for tracks within the provided
   Track Namespace.

   If a publisher receives new subscriptions for that namespace after
   receiving an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL, it SHOULD close the session as a
   'Protocol Violation'.

   ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message {
     Track Namespace (b),
   }

                  Figure 10: MOQT ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.3.1).

6.10.  TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST

   A potential subscriber sends a 'TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST' message on the
   control stream to obtain information about the current status of a
   given track.

   A TRACK_STATUS message MUST be sent in response to each
   TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST.

   TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST Message {
     Track Namespace (b),
     Track Name (b),
   }

                Figure 11: MOQT TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST Message

6.11.  OBJECT

   An OBJECT message contains a range of contiguous bytes from from the
   specified track, as well as associated metadata required to deliver,
   cache, and forward it.  Objects are sent by publishers.

6.11.1.  Canonical Object Fields

   A canonical MoQ Object has the following information:

   *  Track Namespace and Track Name: The track this object belongs to.

   *  Group ID: The object is a member of the indicated group ID
      Section 2.2 within the track.

   *  Object ID: The order of the object within the group.  The IDs
      starts at 0, increasing sequentially for each object within the
      group.

   *  Object Send Order: An integer indicating the object send order
      Section 4.1.1 or priority Section 4.1.2 value.

   *  Object Forwarding Preference: An enumeration indicating how a
      sender sends an object.  The preferences are Track, Group, Object
      and Datagram.  An Object MUST be sent according to its Object
      Forwarding Preference, described below.

   *  Object Status: As enumeration used to indicate missing objects or
      mark the end of a group or track.  See Section 6.11.1.1 below.

   *  Object Payload: An opaque payload intended for the consumer and
      SHOULD NOT be processed by a relay.  Only present when 'Object
      Status' is Normal (0x0).

6.11.1.1.  Object Status

   The Object Status informs subscribers what objects will not be
   received because they were never produced, are no longer available,
   or because they are beyond the end of a group or track.

   Status can have following values:

   *  0x0 := Normal object.  The payload is array of bytes and can be
      empty.

   *  0x1 := Indicates Object does not exist.  Indicates that this
      object does not exist at any publisher and it will not be
      published in the future.  This SHOULD be cached.

   *  0x2 := Indicates Group does not exist.  Indicates that objects
      with this GroupID do not exist at any publisher and they will not
      be published in the future.  This SHOULD be cached.

   *  0x3 := Indicates end of Group.  ObjectId is one greater that the
      largest object produced in the group identified by the GroupID.
      This is sent right after the last object in the group.  This
      SHOULD be cached.

   *  0x4 := Indicates end of Track and Group.  GroupID is one greater
      than the largest group produced in this track and the ObjectId is
      one greater than the largest object produced in that group.  This
      is sent right after the last object in the track.  This SHOULD be
      cached.

   Any other value SHOULD be treated as a protocol error and terminate
   the session with a Protocol Violation (Section 3.5).  Any object with
   a status code other than zero MUST have an empty payload.

   Though some status information could be inferred from QUIC stream
   state, that information is not reliable and cacheable.

   In most cases, messages with a non zero status code are sent on the
   same stream that an object with that GroupID would have been sent on.
   The exception to this is when that stream has been reset; in that
   case they are sent on a new stream.  This is to avoid the status
   message being lost in cases such as a relay dropping a group and
   reseting the stream the group is being sent on.

6.11.2.  Object Message Formats

   Every Track has a single 'Object Forwarding Preference' and
   publishers MUST NOT mix different forwarding preferences within a
   single track.  If a subscriber receives different forwarding
   preferences for a track, it SHOULD close the session with an error of
   'Protocol Violation'.

   *Object Stream Message*

   An OBJECT_STREAM message carries a single object on a stream.  There
   is no explicit length of the payload; it is determined by the end of
   the stream.  An OBJECT_STREAM message MUST be the first and only
   message on a unidirectional stream.

   An Object received in an OBJECT_STREAM message has an Object
   Forwarding Preference = Object.

   To send an Object with Object Forwarding Preference = Object, open a
   stream, serialize object fields below, and terminate the stream.

   OBJECT_STREAM Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Object Send Order (i),
     Object Status (i),
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                   Figure 12: MOQT OBJECT_STREAM Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Track Alias: Identifies the Track Namespace and Track Name as
      defined in Section 6.4.

   If the Track Namespace and Track Name identified by the Track Alias
   are different from those specified in the subscription identified by
   Subscribe ID, the receiver MUST close the session with a Protocol
   Violation.

   *  Other fields: As described in Section 6.11.1.

   *Object Datagram Message*

   An OBJECT_DATAGRAM message carries a single object in a datagram.
   There is no explicit length of the payload; it is determined by the
   length of the datagram.

   An Object received in an OBJECT_DATAGRAM message has an Object
   Forwarding Preference = Datagram.  To send an Object with Object
   Forwarding Preference = Datagram, determine the length of the fields
   and payload and send the Object as datagram.  In certain scenarios
   where the object size can be larger than maximum datagram size for
   the session, the Object will be dropped.

   OBJECT_DATAGRAM Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Object Send Order (i),
     Object Status (i),
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                  Figure 13: MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM Message

6.11.3.  Multi-Object Streams

   When multiple objects are sent on a stream, the stream begins with a
   stream header message and is followed by one or more sets of
   serialized object fields.  If a stream ends gracefully in the middle
   of a serialized Object, terminate the session with a Protocol
   Violation.

   A sender SHOULD NOT open more than one multi-object stream at a time
   with the same stream header message type and fields.

   TODO: figure out how a relay closes these streams

   *Stream Header Track*

   When a stream begins with STREAM_HEADER_TRACK, all objects on the
   stream belong to the track requested in the Subscribe message
   identified by Subscribe ID.  All objects on the stream have the
   Object Send Order specified in the stream header.

   STREAM_HEADER_TRACK Message {
     Subscribe ID (i)
     Track Alias (i),
     Object Send Order (i),
   }

                Figure 14: MOQT STREAM_HEADER_TRACK Message

   All Objects received on a stream opened with STREAM_HEADER_TRACK have
   an Object Forwarding Preference = Track.

   To send an Object with Object Forwarding Preference = Track, find the
   open stream that is associated with the subscription, or open a new
   one and send the STREAM_HEADER_TRACK if needed, then serialize the
   following object fields.  The Object Status field is only sent if the
   Object Payload Length is zero.

   {
     Group ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Object Payload Length (i),
     [Object Status (i)],
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                 Figure 15: MOQT Track Stream Object Fields

   *Stream Header Group*

   A sender MUST NOT send an Object on a stream if its Group ID is less
   than a previously sent Group ID on that stream, or if its Object ID
   is less than or equal to a previously sent Object ID within a given
   group on that stream.

   When a stream begins with STREAM_HEADER_GROUP, all objects on the
   stream belong to the track requested in the Subscribe message
   identified by Subscribe ID and the group indicated by Group ID.  All
   objects on the stream have the Object Send Order specified in the
   stream header.

   STREAM_HEADER_GROUP Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i)
     Object Send Order (i)
   }

                Figure 16: MOQT STREAM_HEADER_GROUP Message

   All Objects received on a stream opened with STREAM_HEADER_GROUP have
   an Object Forwarding Preference = Group.

   To send an Object with Object Forwarding Preference = Group, find the
   open stream that is associated with the subscription, Group ID and
   Object Send Order, or open a new one and send the STREAM_HEADER_GROUP
   if needed, then serialize the following fields.  The Object Status
   field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is zero.

   {
     Object ID (i),
     Object Payload Length (i),
     [Object Status (i)],
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                 Figure 17: MOQT Group Stream Object Fields

   A sender MUST NOT send an Object on a stream if its Object ID is less
   than a previously sent Object ID within a given group in that stream.

6.11.4.  Examples:

   Sending a track on one stream:

   STREAM_HEADER_TRACK {
     Subscribe ID = 1
     Track Alias = 1
     Object Send Order = 0
   }
   {
     Group ID = 0
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "abcd"
   }
   {
     Group ID = 1
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "efgh"
   }

   Sending a group on one stream, with a unordered object in the group
   appearing on its own stream.

   Stream = 2

   STREAM_HEADER_GROUP {
     Subscribe ID = 2
     Track Alias = 2
     Group ID = 0
     Object Send Order = 0
   }
   {
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "abcd"
   }
   {
     Object ID = 1
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "efgh"
   }

   Stream = 6

   OBJECT_STREAM {
     Subscribe ID = 2
     Track Alias = 2
     Group ID = 0
     Object ID = 1
     Payload = "moqrocks"
   }

6.12.  SUBSCRIBE_OK

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_OK control message for successful
   subscriptions.

   SUBSCRIBE_OK
   {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Expires (i),
     ContentExists (f),
     [Largest Group ID (i)],
     [Largest Object ID (i)]
   }

                    Figure 18: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_OK Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Expires: Time in milliseconds after which the subscription is no
      longer valid.  A value of 0 indicates that the subscription does
      not expire or expires at an unknown time.  Expires is advisory and
      a subscription can end prior to the expiry time or last longer.

   *  ContentExists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0
      if not.  If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID
      fields will not be present.

   *  Largest Group ID: the largest Group ID available for this track.
      This field is only present if ContentExists has a value of 1.

   *  Largest Object ID: the largest Object ID available within the
      largest Group ID for this track.  This field is only present if
      ContentExists has a value of 1.

6.13.  SUBSCRIBE_ERROR

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR control message in response to a
   failed SUBSCRIBE.

   SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
   {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase (b),
     Track Alias (i),
   }

                  Figure 19: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ERROR Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for subscription
      failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for subscription error.

   *  Track Alias: When Error Code is 'Retry Track Alias', the
      subscriber SHOULD re-issue the SUBSCRIBE with this Track Alias
      instead.  If this Track Alias is already in use, the receiver MUST
      close the connection with a Duplicate Track Alias error
      (Section 3.5).

6.14.  SUBSCRIBE_DONE

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_DONE message to indicate it is done
   publishing Objects for that subscription.  The Status Code indicates
   why the subscription ended, and whether it was an error.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE_DONE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Status Code (i),
     Reason Phrase (b),
     ContentExists (f),
     [Final Group (i)],
     [Final Object (i)],
   }

                   Figure 20: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Status Code: An integer status code indicating why the
      subscription ended.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for subscription error.

   *  ContentExists: 1 if an object has been published for this
      subscription, 0 if not.  If 0, then the Final Group and Final
      Object fields will not be present.

   *  Final Group: The largest Group ID sent by the publisher in an
      OBJECT message in this track.

   *  Final Object: The largest Object ID sent by the publisher in an
      OBJECT message in the Final Group for this track.

6.15.  ANNOUNCE

   The publisher sends the ANNOUNCE control message to advertise where
   the receiver can route SUBSCRIBEs for tracks within the announced
   Track Namespace.  The receiver verifies the publisher is authorized
   to publish tracks under this namespace.

   ANNOUNCE Message {
     Track Namespace (b),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Parameters (..) ...,
   }

                      Figure 21: MOQT ANNOUNCE Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.3.1)

   *  Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

6.16.  UNANNOUNCE

   The publisher sends the UNANNOUNCE control message to indicate its
   intent to stop serving new subscriptions for tracks within the
   provided Track Namespace.

   UNANNOUNCE Message {
     Track Namespace (b),
   }

                     Figure 22: MOQT UNANNOUNCE Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.3.1).

6.17.  TRACK_STATUS

   A publisher sends a 'TRACK_STATUS' message on the control stream in
   response to a TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST message.

   TRACK_STATUS Message {
     Track Namespace (b),
     Track Name (b),
     Status Code (i),
     Last Group ID (i),
     Last Object ID (i),
   }

                    Figure 23: MOQT TRACK_STATUS Message

   The 'Status Code' field provides additional information about the
   status of the track.  It MUST hold one of the following values.  Any
   other value is a malformed message.

   0x00: The track is in progress, and subsequent fields contain the
   highest group and object ID for that track.

   0x01: The track does not exist.  Subsequent fields MUST be zero, and
   any other value is a malformed message.

   0x02: The track has not yet begun.  Subsequent fields MUST be zero.
   Any other value is a malformed message.

   0x03: The track has finished, so there is no "live edge."  Subsequent
   fields contain the highest Group and object ID known.

   0x04: The sender is a relay that cannot obtain the current track
   status from upstream.  Subsequent fields contain the largest group
   and object ID known.

   Any other value in the Status Code field is a malformed message.

   When a relay is subscribed to a track, it can simply return the
   highest group and object ID it has observed, whether or not that
   object was cached or completely delivered.  If not subscribed, a
   relay SHOULD send a TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST upstream to obtain updated
   information.

   Alternatively, the relay MAY subscribe to the track to obtain the
   same information.

   If a relay cannot or will not do either, it should return its best
   available information with status code 0x04.

   The receiver of multiple TRACK_STATUS messages for a track uses the
   information from the latest arriving message, as they are delivered
   in order on a single stream.

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Expand this section, including subscriptions.

7.1.  Resource Exhaustion

   Live content requires significant bandwidth and resources.  Failure
   to set limits will quickly cause resource exhaustion.

   MOQT uses stream limits and flow control to impose resource limits at
   the network layer.  Endpoints SHOULD set flow control limits based on
   the anticipated bitrate.

   Endpoints MAY impose a MAX STREAM count limit which would restrict
   the number of concurrent streams which a MOQT Streaming Format could
   have in flight.

   The producer prioritizes and transmits streams out of order.  Streams
   might be starved indefinitely during congestion.  The producer and
   consumer MUST cancel a stream, preferably the lowest priority, after
   reaching a resource limit.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: fill out currently missing registries:

   *  MOQT version numbers

   *  Setup parameters

   *  Track Request parameters

   *  Subscribe Error codes

   *  Announce Error codes

   *  Track format numbers

   *  Message types

   *  Object headers

   TODO: register the URI scheme and the ALPN

   TODO: the MOQT spec should establish the IANA registration table for
   MoQ Streaming Formats.  Each MoQ streaming format can then register
   its type in that table.  The MoQ Streaming Format type MUST be
   carried as the leading varint in catalog track objects.
