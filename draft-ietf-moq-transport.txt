                    draft-ietf-moq-transport-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the core behavior for Media over QUIC Transport
   (MOQT), a media transport protocol designed to operate over QUIC and
   WebTransport, which have similar functionality.  MOQT allows a
   producer of media to publish data and have it consumed via
   subscription by a multiplicity of endpoints.  It supports
   intermediate content distribution networks and is designed for high
   scale and low latency distribution.

1.  Introduction

   Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) is a protocol that is optimized for
   the QUIC protocol [QUIC], either directly or via WebTransport
   [WebTransport], for the dissemination of media.  MOQT utilizes a
   publish/subscribe workflow in which producers of media publish data
   in response to subscription requests from a multiplicity of
   endpoints.  MOQT supports wide range of use-cases with different
   resiliency and latency (live, interactive) needs without compromising
   the scalability and cost effectiveness associated with content
   delivery networks.

   MOQT is a generic protocol designed to work in concert with multiple
   MoQ Streaming Formats.  These MoQ Streaming Formats define how
   content is encoded, packaged, and mapped to MOQT objects, along with
   policies for discovery and subscription.

   *  Section 2 describes the object model employed by MOQT.

   *  Section 3 covers aspects of setting up a MOQT session.

   *  Section 4 covers mechanisms for prioritizing subscriptions.

   *  Section 5 covers behavior at the relay entities.

   *  Section 6 covers how control messages are encoded on the wire.

   *  Section 7 covers how data messages are encoded on the wire.

1.1.  Motivation

   The development of MOQT is driven by goals in a number of areas -
   specifically latency, the robust feature set of QUIC and relay
   support.

1.1.1.  Latency

   Latency is necessary to correct for variable network throughput.
   Ideally live content is consumed at the same bitrate it is produced.
   End-to-end latency would be fixed and only subject to encoding and
   transmission delays.  Unfortunately, networks have variable
   throughput, primarily due to congestion.  Attempting to deliver
   content encoded at a higher bitrate than the network can support
   causes queuing along the path from producer to consumer.  The speed
   at which a protocol can detect and respond to congestion determines
   the overall latency.  TCP-based protocols are simple but are slow to
   detect congestion and suffer from head-of-line blocking.  Protocols
   utilizing UDP directly can avoid queuing, but the application is then
   responsible for the complexity of fragmentation, congestion control,
   retransmissions, receiver feedback, reassembly, and more.  One goal
   of MOQT is to achieve the best of both these worlds: leverage the
   features of QUIC to create a simple yet flexible low latency protocol
   that can rapidly detect and respond to congestion.

1.1.2.  Leveraging QUIC

   The parallel nature of QUIC streams can provide improvements in the
   face of loss.  A goal of MOQT is to design a streaming protocol to
   leverage the transmission benefits afforded by parallel QUIC streams
   as well exercising options for flexible loss recovery.

1.1.3.  Convergence

   Some live media architectures today have separate protocols for
   ingest and distribution, for example RTMP and HTTP based HLS or DASH.
   Switching protocols necessitates intermediary origins which re-
   package the media content.  While specialization can have its
   benefits, there are efficiency gains to be had in not having to re-
   package content.  A goal of MOQT is to develop a single protocol
   which can be used for transmission from contribution to distribution.
   A related goal is the ability to support existing encoding and
   packaging schemas, both for backwards compatibility and for
   interoperability with the established content preparation ecosystem.

1.1.4.  Relays

   An integral feature of a protocol being successful is its ability to
   deliver media at scale.  Greatest scale is achieved when third-party
   networks, independent of both the publisher and subscriber, can be
   leveraged to relay the content.  These relays must cache content for
   distribution efficiency while simultaneously routing content and
   deterministically responding to congestion in a multi-tenant network.
   A goal of MOQT is to treat relays as first-class citizens of the
   protocol and ensure that objects are structured such that information
   necessary for distribution is available to relays while the media
   content itself remains opaque and private.

1.2.  Terms and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Client:  The party initiating a Transport Session.

   Server:  The party accepting an incoming Transport Session.

   Endpoint:  A Client or Server.

   Peer:  The other endpoint than the one being described

   Publisher:  An endpoint that handles subscriptions by sending
      requested Objects from the requested track.

   Subscriber:  An endpoint that subscribes to and receives tracks.

   Original Publisher:  The initial publisher of a given track.

   End Subscriber:  A subscriber that initiates a subscription and does
      not send the data on to other subscribers.

   Relay:  An entity that is both a Publisher and a Subscriber, but not
      the Original Publisher or End Subscriber.

   Upstream:  In the direction of the Original Publisher

   Downstream:  In the direction of the End Subscriber(s)

   Transport Session:  A raw QUIC connection or a WebTransport session.

   Object:  An object is an addressable unit whose payload is a sequence
      of bytes.  Objects form the base element in the MOQT data model.
      See (Section 2.1).

   Track:  An encoded bitstream.  Tracks contain a sequential series of
      one or more groups and are the subscribable entity with MOQT.  See
      (Section 2.4).

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   This document uses the conventions detailed in ([RFC9000],
   Section 1.3) when describing the binary encoding.

   As a quick reference, the following list provides a non normative
   summary of the parts of RFC9000 field syntax that are used in this
   specification.

   x (L):  Indicates that x is L bits long

   x (i):  Indicates that x holds an integer value using the variable-
      length encoding as described in ([RFC9000], Section 16)

   x (..):  Indicates that x can be any length including zero bits long.
      Values in this format always end on a byte boundary.

   [x (L)]:  Indicates that x is optional and has a length of L

   x (L) ...:  Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times and that
      each instance has a length of L

   This document extends the RFC9000 syntax and with the additional
   field types:

   x (b):  Indicates that x consists of a variable length integer
      encoding as described in ([RFC9000], Section 16), followed by that
      many bytes of binary data

   x (tuple):  Indicates that x is a tuple, consisting of a variable
      length integer encoded as described in ([RFC9000], Section 16),
      followed by that many variable length tuple fields, each of which
      are encoded as (b) above.

   To reduce unnecessary use of bandwidth, variable length integers
   SHOULD be encoded using the least number of bytes possible to
   represent the required value.

2.  Object Data Model

   MOQT has a hierarchical data model, comprised of tracks which contain
   groups, and groups that contain objects.  Inside of a group, the
   objects can be organized into subgroups.

   To give an example of how an application might use this data model,
   consider an application sending high and low resolution video using a
   codec with temporal scalability.  Each resolution is sent as a
   separate track to allow the subscriber to pick the appropriate
   resolution given the display environment and available bandwidth.
   Each "group of pictures" in a video is sent as a group because the
   first frame is needed to decode later frames.  This allows the client
   to join at the logical points where they can get the information to
   start decoding the stream.  The temporal layers are sent as separate
   sub groups to allow the priority mechanism to favour the base layer
   when there is not enough bandwidth to send both the base and
   enhancement layers.  Each frame of video on a given layer is sent as
   a single object.

2.1.  Objects

   The basic data element of MOQT is an object.  An object is an
   addressable unit whose payload is a sequence of bytes.  All objects
   belong to a group, indicating ordering and potential dependencies.
   Section 2.3 An object is uniquely identified by its track namespace,
   track name, group ID, and object ID, and must be an identical
   sequence of bytes regardless of how or where it is retrieved.  An
   Object can become unavailable, but its contents MUST NOT change over
   time.

   Objects are comprised of two parts: metadata and a payload.  The
   metadata is never encrypted and is always visible to relays (see
   Section 5).  The payload portion may be encrypted, in which case it
   is only visible to the Original Publisher and End Subscribers.  The
   Original Publisher is solely responsible for the content of the
   object payload.  This includes the underlying encoding, compression,
   any end-to-end encryption, or authentication.  A relay MUST NOT
   combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.

   Objects within a group are ordered numerically by their Object ID.

2.2.  Subgroups

   A subgroup is a sequence of one or more objects from the same group
   (Section 2.3) in ascending order by Object ID.  Objects in a subgroup
   have a dependency and priority relationship consistent with sharing a
   QUIC stream.  In some cases, a Group will be most effectively
   delivered using more than one QUIC stream.

   When a Track's forwarding preference (see Section 7.1.1) is "Track"
   or "Datagram", Objects are not sent in Subgroups, no Subgroup IDs are
   assigned, and the description in the remainder of this section does
   not apply.

   QUIC streams offer in-order reliable delivery and the ability to
   cancel sending and retransmission of data.  Furthermore, many
   implementations offer the ability to control the relative priority of
   streams, which allows control over the scheduling of sending data on
   active streams.

   Every object within a Group belongs to exactly one Subgroup.

   Objects from two subgroups cannot be sent on the same QUIC stream.
   Objects from the same Subgroup MUST NOT be sent on different QUIC
   streams, unless one of the streams was reset prematurely, or upstream
   conditions have forced objects from a Subgroup to be sent out of
   Object ID order.

   Original publishers assign each Subgroup a Subgroup ID, and do so as
   they see fit.  The scope of a Subgroup ID is a Group, so Subgroups
   from different Groups MAY share a Subgroup ID without implying any
   relationship between them.  In general, publishers assign objects to
   subgroups in order to leverage the features of QUIC streams as
   described above.

   An example strategy for using QUIC stream properties follows.  If
   object B is dependent on object A, then delivery of B can follow A,
   i.e. A and B can be usefully delivered over a single QUIC stream.
   Furthermore, in this example:

   *  If an object is dependent on all previous objects in a Subgroup,
      it is added to that Subgroup.

   *  If an object is not dependent on all of the objects in a Subgroup,
      it goes in a different Subgroup.

   *  There are often many ways to compose Subgroups that meet these
      criteria.  Where possible, choose the composition that results in
      the fewest Subgroups in a group to minimize the number of QUIC
      streams used.

2.3.  Groups

   A group is a collection of objects and is a sub-unit of a track
   (Section 2.4).  Groups SHOULD be indendepently useful, so objects
   within a group SHOULD NOT depend on objects in other groups.  A group
   provides a join point for subscriptions, so a subscriber that does
   not want to receive the entire track can opt to receive only the
   latest group(s).  The publisher then selectively transmits objects
   based on their group membership.  Groups can contain any number of
   objects.

   Groups are ordered numerically by their Group ID.

2.4.  Track

   A track is a sequence of groups (Section 2.3).  It is the entity
   against which a subscriber issues a subscription request.  A
   subscriber can request to receive individual tracks starting at a
   group boundary, including any new objects pushed by the publisher
   while the track is active.

2.4.1.  Track Naming and Scopes

   In MOQT, every track has a track name and a track namespace
   associated with it.  A track name identifies an individual track
   within the namespace.

   Track namespace is an ordered N-tuple of bytes where N can be between
   1 and 32.  The structured nature of Track Namespace allows relays and
   applications to manipulate prefixes of a namespace.  Track name is a
   sequence of bytes.  If an endpoint receives a Track Namespace tuple
   with an N of 0 or more than 32, it MUST close the session with a
   Protocol Violation.

   In this specification, both the Track Namespace tuple fields and the
   Track Name are not constrained to a specific encoding.  They carry a
   sequence of bytes and comparison between two Track Namespace tuple
   fields or Track Names is done by exact comparison of the bytes.
   Specifications that use MoQ Transport may constrain the information
   in these fields, for example by restricting them to UTF-8.  Any
   specification that does needs to specify the canonicalization into
   the bytes in the Track Namespace or Track Name such that exact
   comparison works.

2.4.2.  Scope

   A MOQT scope is a set of servers (as identified by their connection
   URIs) for which the tuple of Track Name and Track Namespace are
   guaranteed to be unique and identify a specific track.  It is up to
   the application using MOQT to define how broad or narrow the scope
   is.  An application that deals with connections between devices on a
   local network may limit the scope to a single connection; by
   contrast, an application that uses multiple CDNs to serve media may
   require the scope to include all of those CDNs.

   Because the tuple of Track Namespace and Track Name are unique within
   an MOQT scope, they can be used as a cache key.  MOQT does not
   provide any in-band content negotiation methods similar to the ones
   defined by HTTP ([RFC9110], Section 10); if, at a given moment in
   time, two tracks within the same scope contain different data, they
   have to have different names and/or namespaces.

2.4.3.  Connection URL

   Each track MAY have one or more associated connection URLs specifying
   network hosts through which a track may be accessed.  The syntax of
   the Connection URL and the associated connection setup procedures are
   specific to the underlying transport protocol usage Section 3.

3.  Sessions

3.1.  Session establishment

   This document defines a protocol that can be used interchangeably
   both over a QUIC connection directly [QUIC], and over WebTransport
   [WebTransport].  Both provide streams and datagrams with similar
   semantics (see [I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview], Section 4); thus, the
   main difference lies in how the servers are identified and how the
   connection is established.  When using QUIC, datagrams MUST be
   supported via the [QUIC-DATAGRAM] extension, which is already a
   requirement for WebTransport over HTTP/3.

   There is no definition of the protocol over other transports, such as
   TCP, and applications using MoQ might need to fallback to another
   protocol when QUIC or WebTransport aren't available.

3.1.1.  WebTransport

   A MOQT server that is accessible via WebTransport can be identified
   using an HTTPS URI ([RFC9110], Section 4.2.2).  A MOQT session can be
   established by sending an extended CONNECT request to the host and
   the path indicated by the URI, as described in [WebTransport],
   Section 3.

3.1.2.  QUIC

   A MOQT server that is accessible via native QUIC can be identified by
   a URI with a "moqt" scheme.  The "moqt" URI scheme is defined as
   follows, using definitions from [RFC3986]:

   moqt-URI = "moqt" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The authority portion MUST NOT contain an empty host portion.  The
   moqt URI scheme supports the /.well-known/ path prefix defined in
   [RFC8615].

   This protocol does not specify any semantics on the path-abempty and
   query portions of the URI.  The contents of those are left up to the
   application.

   The client can establish a connection to a MoQ server identified by a
   given URI by setting up a QUIC connection to the host and port
   identified by the authority section of the URI.  The path-abempty and
   query portions of the URI are communicated to the server using the
   PATH parameter (Section 6.2.2.1) which is sent in the CLIENT_SETUP
   message at the start of the session.  The ALPN value [RFC7301] used
   by the protocol is moq-00.

3.2.  Version and Extension Negotiation

   Endpoints use the exchange of Setup messages to negotiate the MOQT
   version and any extensions to use.

   The client indicates the MOQT versions it supports in the
   CLIENT_SETUP message (see Section 6.2).  It also includes the union
   of all Setup Parameters Section 6.2.2 required for a handshake by any
   of those versions.

   Within any MOQT version, clients request the use of extensions by
   adding Setup parameters corresponding to that extension.  No
   extensions are defined in this document.

   The server replies with a SERVER_SETUP message that indicates the
   chosen version, includes all parameters required for a handshake in
   that version, and parameters for every extension requested by the
   client that it supports.

   New versions of MOQT MUST specify which existing extensions can be
   used with that version.  New extensions MUST specify the existing
   versions with which they can be used.

   If a given parameter carries the same information in multiple
   versions, but might have different optimal values in those versions,
   there SHOULD be separate Setup parameters for that information in
   each version.

3.3.  Session initialization

   The first stream opened is a client-initiated bidirectional control
   stream where the endpoints exchange Setup messages (Section 6.2).
   All messages defined in this draft except OBJECT and
   OBJECT_WITH_LENGTH are sent on the control stream after the Setup
   message.  Control messages MUST NOT be sent on any other stream, and
   a peer receiving a control message on a different stream closes the
   session as a 'Protocol Violation'.  Objects MUST NOT be sent on the
   control stream, and a peer receiving an Object on the control stream
   closes the session as a 'Protocol Violation'.

   This draft only specifies a single use of bidirectional streams.
   Objects are sent on unidirectional streams.  Because there are no
   other uses of bidirectional streams, a peer MAY currently close the
   session as a 'Protocol Violation' if it receives a second
   bidirectional stream.

   The control stream MUST NOT be closed at the underlying transport
   layer while the session is active.  Doing so results in the session
   being closed as a 'Protocol Violation'.

3.4.  Stream Cancellation

   Streams aside from the control stream MAY be canceled due to
   congestion or other reasons by either the publisher or subscriber.
   Early termination of a stream does not affect the MoQ application
   state, and therefore has no effect on outstanding subscriptions.

3.5.  Termination

   The Transport Session can be terminated at any point.  When native
   QUIC is used, the session is closed using the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
   ([QUIC], Section 19.19).  When WebTransport is used, the session is
   closed using the CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule ([WebTransport],
   Section 5).

   The application MAY use any error message and SHOULD use a relevant

                                 Table 1

   *  No Error: The session is being terminated without an error.

   *  Internal Error: An implementation specific error occurred.

   *  Unauthorized: The endpoint breached an agreement, which MAY have
      been pre-negotiated by the application.

   *  Protocol Violation: The remote endpoint performed an action that
      was disallowed by the specification.

   *  Duplicate Track Alias: The endpoint attempted to use a Track Alias
      that was already in use.

   *  Too Many Subscribes: The session was closed because the subscriber
      used a Subscribe ID equal or larger than the current Maximum
      Subscribe ID.

   *  GOAWAY Timeout: The session was closed because the peer took too
      long to close the session in response to a GOAWAY (Section 6.3)
      message.  See session migration (Section 3.6).

   *  Control Message Timeout: The session was closed because the peer
      took too long to respond to a control message.

   *  Data Stream Timeout: The session was closed because the peer took
      too long to send data expected on an open Data Stream Section 7.
      This includes fields of a stream header or an object header within
      a data stream.  If an endpoint times out waiting for a new object
      header on an open subgroup stream, it MAY send a STOP_SENDING on
      that stream, terminate the subscription, or close the session with
      an error.

3.6.  Migration

   MOQT requires a long-lived and stateful session.  However, a service
   provider needs the ability to shutdown/restart a server without
   waiting for all sessions to drain naturally, as that can take days
   for long-form media.  MOQT enables proactively draining sessions via
   the GOAWAY message (Section 6.3).

   The server sends a GOAWAY message, signaling the client to establish
   a new session and migrate any active subscriptions.  The GOAWAY
   message optionally contains a new URI for the new session, otherwise
   the current URI is reused.  The server SHOULD terminate the session
   with 'GOAWAY Timeout' after a sufficient timeout if there are still
   open subscriptions or fetches on a connection.

   When the server is a subscriber, it SHOULD send a GOAWAY message to
   downstream subscribers prior to any UNSUBSCRIBE messages to upstream
   publishers.

   After the client receives a GOAWAY, it's RECOMMENDED that the client
   waits until there are no more active subscriptions before closing the
   session with NO_ERROR.  Ideally this is transparent to the
   application using MOQT, which involves establishing a new session in
   the background and migrating active subscriptions and announcements.
   The client can choose to delay closing the session if it expects more
   OBJECTs to be delivered.  The server closes the session with a
   'GOAWAY Timeout' if the client doesn't close the session quickly
   enough.

4.  Priorities

   MoQ priorities allow a subscriber and original publisher to influence
   the transmission order of Objects within a session in the presence of
   congestion.

4.1.  Definitions

   MoQT maintains priorities between different _schedulable objects_. A
   schedulable object in MoQT is either:

   1.  An object that belongs to a subgroup where that object would be
       the next object to be sent in that subgroup.

   2.  An object that belongs to a track with delivery preference
       Datagram.

   Since a single subgroup or datagram has a single publisher priority,
   it can be useful to conceptualize this process as scheduling
   subgroups or datagrams instead of individual objects on them.

   A _priority number_ is an unsigned integer with a value between 0 and
   255.  A lower priority number indicates higher priority; the highest
   priority is 0.

   _Subscriber Priority_ is a priority number associated with an
   individual subscription.  It is specified in the SUBSCRIBE message,
   and can be updated via SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE message.  The subscriber
   priority of an individual schedulable object is the subscriber
   priority of the subscription that caused that object to be sent.
   When subscriber priority is changed, a best effort SHOULD be made to
   change the apply that to all objects that have not been sent, but it
   is implementation dependent what happens to objects that have already
   been received and possibly scheduled.

   _Publisher Priority_ is a priority number associated with an
   individual schedulable object.  It is specified in the header of the
   respective subgroup or datagram, and is the same for all objects in a
   single subgroup.

   _Group Order_ is a property of an invidual subscription.  It can be
   either 'Ascending' (groups with lower group ID are sent first), or
   'Descending' (groups with higher group ID are sent first).  The
   publisher communicates its group order in the SUBSCRIBE_OK message;
   the subscriber can override it in its SUBSCRIBE message.  The group
   order of an existing subscription cannot be changed.

4.2.  Scheduling Algorithm

   When an MoQT publisher has multiple schedulable objects it can choose
   between, the objects SHOULD be selected as follows:

   1.  If two objects have a different subscriber priority associated
       with them, the one with *the highest subscriber priority* is sent
       first.

   2.  If two objects have the same subscriber priority, but a different
       publisher priority, the one with *the highest publisher priority*
       is sent first.

   3.  If two objects have the same subscriber and publisher priority,
       but belong to two different groups of the same track received
       through the same subscription, *the group order* of the
       associated subscription is used to decide the one that is sent
       first.

   4.  If two objects belong to the same group of the same track
       received through the same subscription, the one with *the lowest
       Subgroup ID* (for tracks with delivery preference Subgroup), or
       *the lowest Object ID* (for tracks with delivery preference
       Datagram) is sent first.

   This algorithm does not provide a well-defined ordering for objects
   that belong to different subscriptions, but have the same subscriber
   and publisher priority.  The ordering in those cases is
   implementation-defined, though the expectation is that all
   subscriptions will be able to send some data.

   Given the critical nature of control messages and their relatively
   small size, the control stream SHOULD be prioritized higher than all
   subscribed Objects.

4.3.  Considerations for Setting Priorities

   Relays SHOULD respect the subscriber and original publisher's
   priorities.  Relays SHOULD NOT directly use Subscriber Priority or
   Group Order from incoming subscriptions for upstream subscriptions.
   Relays use of Subscriber Priority for upstream subscriptions can be
   based on factors specific to it, such as the popularity of the
   content or policy, or relays can specify the same value for all
   upstream subscriptions.

   MoQ Sessions can span multiple namespaces, and priorities might not
   be coordinated across namespaces.  The subscriber's priority is
   considered first, so there is a mechanism for a subscriber to fix
   incompatibilities between different namespaces prioritization
   schemes.  Additionally, it is anticipated that when multiple
   namespaces are present within a session, the namespaces could be
   coordinating, possibly part of the same application.  In cases when
   pooling among namespaces is expected to cause issues, multiple MoQ
   sessions, either within a single connection or on multiple
   connections can be used.

   Implementations that have a default priority SHOULD set it to a value
   in the middle of the range (eg: 128) to allow non-default priorities
   to be set either higher or lower.

5.  Relays

   Relays are leveraged to enable distribution scale in the MoQ
   architecture.  Relays can be used to form an overlay delivery
   network, similar in functionality to Content Delivery Networks
   (CDNs).  Additionally, relays serve as policy enforcement points by
   validating subscribe and publish requests at the edge of a network.

   Relays are endpoints, which means they terminate Transport Sessions
   in order to have visibility of MoQ Object metadata.

   Relays MAY cache Objects, but are not required to.

5.1.  Subscriber Interactions

   Subscribers interact with the Relays by sending a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH
   control message for the tracks of interest.  Relays MUST ensure
   subscribers are authorized to access the content associated with the
   track.  The authorization information can be part of subscription
   request itself or part of the encompassing session.  The specifics of
   how a relay authorizes a user are outside the scope of this
   specification.  The subscriber is notified of the result of the
   subscription via a SUBSCRIBE_OK (Section 6.15) or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
   Section 6.16 control message.  The entity receiving the SUBSCRIBE
   MUST send only a single response to a given SUBSCRIBE of either
   SUBSCRIBE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR.

   The relay will have to send an upstream SUBSCRIBE and/or FETCH if it
   does not have all the objects in the FETCH, or is not currently
   subscribed to the full requested range.  In this case, it SHOULD
   withhold sending its own SUBSCRIBE_OK until receiving one from
   upstream.  It MUST withhold FETCH_OK until receiving one from
   upstream.

   For successful subscriptions, the publisher maintains a list of
   subscribers for each track.  Each new OBJECT belonging to the track
   within the subscription range is forwarded to each active subscriber,
   dependent on the congestion response.  A subscription remains active
   until soon after the publisher of the track terminates the
   subscription with a SUBSCRIBE_DONE (see Section 6.19).

   A caching relay saves Objects to its cache identified by the Object's
   Full Track Name, Group ID and Object ID.  Relays MUST be able to
   process objects for the same Full Track Name from multiple publishers
   and forward objects to active matching subscriptions.  If multiple
   objects are received with the same Full Track Name, Group ID and
   Object ID, Relays MAY ignore subsequently received Objects or MAY use
   them to update the cache.  Implementations that update the cache need
   to protect against cache poisoning.

   Caching can also reduce the number of upstream FETCH requests.

   Objects MUST NOT be sent for unsuccessful subscriptions, and if a
   subscriber receives a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR after receiving objects, it
   MUST close the session with a 'Protocol Violation'.

   A relay MUST NOT reorder or drop objects received on a multi-object
   stream when forwarding to subscribers, unless it has application
   specific information.

   Relays MAY aggregate authorized subscriptions for a given track when
   multiple subscribers request the same track.  Subscription
   aggregation allows relays to make only a single upstream subscription
   for the track.  The published content received from the upstream
   subscription request is cached and shared among the pending
   subscribers.

   The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in SUBSCRIBE_ERROR,
   as defined below:

                      +======+======================+
                      | Code | Reason               |

                                  Table 2

   The application SHOULD use a relevant status code in SUBSCRIBE_DONE,
   as defined below:

                                  Table 3

5.1.1.  Graceful Publisher Relay Switchover

   This section describes behavior a subscriber MAY implement to allow
   for a better user experience when a relay sends a GOAWAY.

   When a subscriber receives the GOAWAY message, it starts the process
   of connecting to a new relay and sending the SUBSCRIBE requests for
   all active subscriptions to the new relay.  The new relay will send a
   response to the subscribes and if they are successful, the
   subscriptions to the old relay can be stopped with an UNSUBSCRIBE.

5.2.  Publisher Interactions

   Publishing through the relay starts with publisher sending ANNOUNCE
   control message with a Track Namespace (Section 2.4).  The ANNOUNCE
   enables the relay to know which publisher to forward a SUBSCRIBE to
   if the track belongs to the namespace in the ANNOUNCE.

   Relays MUST verify that publishers are authorized to publish the
   content associated with the set of tracks whose Track Namespace
   matches the announced namespace.  Where the authorization and
   identification of the publisher occurs depends on the way the relay
   is managed and is application specific.

   Relays respond with an ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR control message
   providing the result of announcement.  The entity receiving the
   ANNOUNCE MUST send only a single response to a given ANNOUNCE of
   either ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR.

   A Relay can receive announcements from multiple publishers for the
   same Track Namespace and it SHOULD respond with the same response to
   each of the publishers, as though it was responding to an ANNOUNCE
   from a single publisher for a given track namespace.

   When a publisher wants to stop new subscriptions for an announced
   namespace it sends an UNANNOUNCE.  A subscriber indicates it will no
   longer route subscriptions for a namespace it previously responded
   ANNOUNCE_OK to by sending an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL.

   A relay manages sessions from multiple publishers and subscribers,
   connecting them based on the track namespace.  This MUST use an exact
   match on track namespace unless otherwise negotiated by the
   application.  For example, a SUBSCRIBE namespace=foobar message will
   be forwarded to the session that sent ANNOUNCE namespace=foobar.

   When a relay receives an incoming SUBSCRIBE request that triggers an
   upstream subscription, it SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE request to each
   publisher that has announced the subscription's namespace, unless it
   already has an active subscription for the Objects requested by the
   incoming SUBSCRIBE request from all available publishers.

   When a relay receives an incoming ANNOUNCE for a given namespace, for
   each active upstream subscription that matches that namespace, it
   SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE to the publisher that sent the ANNOUNCE.

   OBJECT message headers carry a short hop-by-hop Track Alias that maps
   to the Full Track Name (see Section 6.15).  Relays use the Track
   Alias of an incoming OBJECT message to identify its track and find
   the active subscribers for that track.  Relays MUST forward OBJECT
   messages to matching subscribers in accordance to each subscription's
   priority, group order, and delivery timeout.

5.2.1.  Graceful Publisher Network Switchover

   This section describes behavior that a publisher MAY choose to
   implement to allow for a better users experience when switching
   between networks, such as WiFi to Cellular or vice versa.

   If the original publisher detects it is likely to need to switch
   networks, for example because the WiFi signal is getting weaker, and
   it does not have QUIC connection migration available, it establishes
   a new session over the new interface and sends an ANNOUCE.  The relay
   will forward matching subscribes and the publisher publishes objects
   on both sessions.  Once the subscriptions have migrated over to
   session on the new network, the publisher can stop publishing objects
   on the old network.  The relay will drop duplicate objects received
   on both subscriptions.  Ideally, the subscriptions downstream from
   the relay do no observe this change, and keep receiving the objects
   on the same subscription.

5.2.2.  Graceful Publisher Relay Switchover

   This section describes behavior that a publisher MAY choose to
   implement to allow for a better user experience when a relay sends
   them a GOAWAY.

   When a publisher receives a GOAWAY, it starts the process of
   connecting to a new relay and sends announces, but it does not
   immediately stop publishing objects to the old relay.  The new relay
   will send subscribes and the publisher can start sending new objects
   to the new relay instead of the old relay.  Once objects are going to
   the new relay, the announcement and subscription to the old relay can
   be stopped.

5.3.  Relay Object Handling

   MOQT encodes the delivery information for a stream via OBJECT headers
   (Section 7.1).  A relay MUST NOT modify Object properties when
   forwarding.

   A relay MUST treat the object payload as opaque.  A relay MUST NOT
   combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.  A relay SHOULD
   prioritize sending Objects based on Section 4.

   A publisher SHOULD begin sending incomplete objects when available to
   avoid incurring additional latency.

   A relay that reads from one stream and writes to another in order can
   introduce head-of-line blocking.  Packet loss will cause stream data
   to be buffered in the library, awaiting in-order delivery, which
   could increase latency over additional hops.  To mitigate this, a
   relay MAY read and write stream data out of order subject to flow
   control limits.  See section 2.2 in [QUIC].

6.  Control Messages

   MOQT uses a single bidirectional stream to exchange control messages,
   as defined in Section 3.3.  Every single message on the control
   stream is formatted as follows:

   MOQT Control Message {
     Message Type (i),
     Message Length (i),
     Message Payload (..),
   }

                                 Table 4

   An endpoint that receives an unknown message type MUST close the
   session.  Control messages have a length to make parsing easier, but
   no control messages are intended to be ignored.  If the length does
   not match the length of the message content, the receiver MUST close
   the session.

6.1.  Parameters

   Some messages include a Parameters field that encode optional message
   elements.  They contain a type, length, and value.

   Senders MUST NOT repeat the same parameter type in a message.
   Receivers SHOULD check that there are no duplicate parameters and
   close the session as a 'Protocol Violation' if found.

   Receivers ignore unrecognized parameters.

   The format of Parameters is as follows:

   Parameter {
     Parameter Type (i),
     Parameter Length (i),
     Parameter Value (..),
   }

                          Figure 2: MOQT Parameter

   Parameter Type is an integer that indicates the semantic meaning of
   the parameter.  Setup message parameters use a namespace that is
   constant across all MoQ Transport versions.  All other messages use a
   version-specific namespace.  For example, the integer '1' can refer
   to different parameters for Setup messages and for all other message
   types.

   SETUP message parameter types are defined in Section 6.2.2.  Version-
   specific parameter types are defined in Section 6.1.1.

   The Parameter Length field of the String Parameter encodes the length
   of the Parameter Value field in bytes.

   Each parameter description will indicate the data type in the
   Parameter Value field.  If a receiver understands a parameter type,
   and the parameter length implied by that type does not match the
   Parameter Length field, the receiver MUST terminate the session with
   error code 'Parameter Length Mismatch'.

6.1.1.  Version Specific Parameters

   Each version-specific parameter definition indicates the message
   types in which it can appear.  If it appears in some other type of
   message, it MUST be ignored.  Note that since Setup parameters use a
   separate namespace, it is impossible for these parameters to appear
   in Setup messages.

6.1.1.1.  AUTHORIZATION INFO

   AUTHORIZATION INFO parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) identifies a
   track's authorization information in a SUBSCRIBE,
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES, ANNOUNCE or FETCH message.  This parameter is
   populated for cases where the authorization is required at the track
   level.  The value is an ASCII string.

6.1.1.2.  DELIVERY TIMEOUT Parameter

   The DELIVERY TIMEOUT parameter (Parameter Type 0x03) MAY appear in a
   SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_OK, or a SUBSCRIBE_UDPATE message.  It is the
   duration in milliseconds the relay SHOULD continue to attempt
   forwarding Objects after they have been received.  The start time for
   the timeout is based on when the beginning of the Object is received,
   and does not depend upon the forwarding preference.  There is no
   explicit signal that an Object was not sent because the delivery
   timeout was exceeded.

   If both the subscriber and publisher specify the parameter, they use
   the min of the two values for the subscription.  The publisher SHOULD
   always specify the value received from an upstream subscription when
   there is one, and nothing otherwise.  If an earlier Object arrives
   later than subsequent Objects, relays can consider the receipt time
   as that of the next later Object, with the assumption that the
   Object's data was reordered.

   If neither the subscriber or publisher specify DELIVERY TIMEOUT, all
   Objects in the track matching the subscription filter are delivered
   as indicated by their Group Order and Priority.  If a subscriber
   exceeds the publisher's resource limits by failing to consume objects
   at a sufficient rate, the publisher MAY terminate the subscription
   with error 'Too Far Behind'.

   If an object in a subgroup exceeds the delivery timeout, the
   publisher MUST reset the underlying transport stream (see
   Section 7.4.2).

   When sent by a subscriber, this parameter is intended to be specific
   to a subscription, so it SHOULD NOT be forwarded upstream by a relay
   that intends to serve multiple subscriptions for the same track.

   Publishers SHOULD consider whether the entire Object is likely to be
   delivered before sending any data for that Object, taking into
   account priorities, congestion control, and any other relevant
   information.

6.1.1.3.  MAX CACHE DURATION Parameter

   MAX_CACHE_DURATION (Parameter Type 0x04): An integer expressing a
   number of milliseconds.  If present, the relay MUST NOT start
   forwarding any individual Object received through this subscription
   after the specified number of milliseconds has elapsed since the
   beginning of the Object was received.  This means Objects earlier in
   a multi-object stream will expire earlier than Objects later in the
   stream.  Once Objects have expired, their state becomes unknown, and
   a relay that handles a subscription that includes those Objects re-
   requests them.

6.2.  CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP

   The CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP messages are the first messages
   exchanged by the client and the server; they allow the endpoints to
   establish the mutually supported version and agree on the initial
   configuration before any objects are exchanged.  It is a sequence of
   key-value pairs called Setup parameters; the semantics and format of
   which can vary based on whether the client or server is sending.  To
   ensure future extensibility of MOQT, endpoints MUST ignore unknown
   setup parameters.  TODO: describe GREASE for those.

   The wire format of the Setup messages are as follows:

   CLIENT_SETUP Message {
     Type (i) = 0x40,
     Length (i),
     Number of Supported Versions (i),
     Supported Version (i) ...,
     Number of Parameters (i) ...,
     Setup Parameters (..) ...,
   }

   SERVER_SETUP Message {
     Type (i) = 0x41,
     Length (i),
     Selected Version (i),
     Number of Parameters (i) ...,
     Setup Parameters (..) ...,
   }

                       Figure 3: MOQT Setup Messages

   The available versions and Setup parameters are detailed in the next
   sections.

6.2.1.  Versions

   MoQ Transport versions are a 32-bit unsigned integer, encoded as a
   varint.  This version of the specification is identified by the
   number 0x00000001.  Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the
   version number cleared are reserved for use in future IETF consensus
   documents.

   The client offers the list of the protocol versions it supports; the
   server MUST reply with one of the versions offered by the client.  If
   the server does not support any of the versions offered by the
   client, or the client receives a server version that it did not
   offer, the corresponding peer MUST close the session.

   [[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before
   publication.]]

   The version number for the final version of this specification
   (0x00000001), is reserved for the version of the protocol that is
   published as an RFC.  Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts
   are created by adding the draft number to 0xff000000.  For example,
   draft-ietf-moq-transport-13 would be identified as 0xff00000D.

6.2.2.  Setup Parameters

6.2.2.1.  PATH

   The PATH parameter (Parameter Type 0x01) allows the client to specify
   the path of the MoQ URI when using native QUIC ([QUIC]).  It MUST NOT
   be used by the server, or when WebTransport is used.  If the peer
   receives a PATH parameter from the server, or when WebTransport is
   used, it MUST close the connection.  It follows the URI formatting
   rules [RFC3986].

   When connecting to a server using a URI with the "moqt" scheme, the
   client MUST set the PATH parameter to the path-abempty portion of the
   URI; if query is present, the client MUST concatenate ?, followed by
   the query portion of the URI to the parameter.

6.2.2.2.  MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID

   The MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) communicates an
   initial value for the Maximum Subscribe ID to the receiving
   subscriber.  The default value is 0, so if not specified, the peer
   MUST NOT create subscriptions.

6.3.  GOAWAY

   An endpoint sends a GOAWAY message to inform the peer it intends to
   close the session soon.  Servers can use GOAWAY to initiate session
   migration (Section 3.6) with an optional URI.

   The GOAWAY message does not impact subscription state.  A subscriber
   SHOULD individually UNSUBSCRIBE for each existing subscription, while
   a publisher MAY reject new requests while in the draining state.

   Upon receiving a GOAWAY, an endpoint SHOULD NOT initiate new requests
   to the peer including SUBSCRIBE, FETCH, ANNOUNCE and
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCE.

   The endpoint MUST terminate the session with a Protocol Violation
   (Section 3.5) if it receives multiple GOAWAY messages.

   GOAWAY Message {
     Type (i) = 0x10,
     Length (i),
     New Session URI Length (i),
     New Session URI (..),
   }

                       Figure 4: MOQT GOAWAY Message

   *  New Session URI: When received by a client, indicates where the
      client can connect to continue this session.  The client MUST use
      this URI for the new session if provided.  If the URI is zero
      bytes long, the client can reuse the current URI is reused
      instead.  The new session URI SHOULD use the same scheme as the
      current URL to ensure compatibility.

      If a server receives a GOAWAY with a non-zero New Session URI
      Length it MUST terminate the session with a Protocol Violation.

6.4.  SUBSCRIBE

   A subscription causes the publisher to send newly published objects
   for a track.  A subscriber MUST NOT make multiple active
   subscriptions for a track within a single session and publishers
   SHOULD treat this as a protocol violation.  The only objects prior to
   the current object that can be requested are those in the current
   group.

   *Filter Types*

   The subscriber specifies a filter on the subscription to allow the
   publisher to identify which objects need to be delivered.

   There are 4 types of filters:

   Latest Group (0x1) : Specifies an open-ended subscription with
   objects from the beginning of the current group.  If no content has
   been delivered yet, the subscription starts with the first published
   or received group.

   Latest Object (0x2): Specifies an open-ended subscription beginning
   from the current object of the current group.  If no content has been
   delivered yet, the subscription starts with the first published or
   received group.

   AbsoluteStart (0x3): Specifies an open-ended subscription beginning
   from the object identified in the StartGroup and StartObject fields.
   If the StartGroup is prior to the current group, the publisher MUST
   reply with a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR with code 'Invalid Range'.

   AbsoluteRange (0x4): Specifies a closed subscription starting at
   StartObject in StartGroup and ending at EndObject in EndGroup.  The
   start and end of the range are inclusive.  EndGroup MUST specify the
   same or a later group than StartGroup.  If the StartGroup is prior to
   the current group, the publisher MUST reply with a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
   with code 'Invalid Range'.

   A filter type other than the above MUST be treated as error.

   If a subscriber wants to subscribe to Objects both before and after
   the Latest Object, it can send a SUBSCRIBE for the Latest Object
   followed by a FETCH.  Depending upon the application, one might want
   to send both messages at the same time or wait for the first to
   return before sending the second.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE Message {
     Type (i) = 0x3,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Alias (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Track Name Length (i),
     Track Name (..),
     Subscriber Priority (8),
     Group Order (8),
     Filter Type (i),
     [StartGroup (i),
      StartObject (i)],
     [EndGroup (i)],
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
   }

                      Figure 5: MOQT SUBSCRIBE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The subscriber specified identifier used to manage a
      subscription.  Subscribe ID is a variable length integer that MUST
      be unique and monotonically increasing within a session and MUST
      be less than the session's Maximum Subscribe ID.

   *  Track Alias: A session specific identifier for the track.
      Messages that reference a track, such as OBJECT (Section 7.1),
      reference this Track Alias instead of the Track Name and Track
      Namespace to reduce overhead.  If the Track Alias is already being
      used for a different track, the publisher MUST close the session
      with a Duplicate Track Alias error (Section 3.5).

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined
      in (Section 2.4.1).

   *  Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in
      (Section 2.4.1).

   *  Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription
      relative to other subscriptions in the same session.  Lower
      numbers get higher priority.  See Section 4.

   *  Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered
      in Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group.  See
      Section 4.  A value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's
      Group Order SHOULD be used.  Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol
      error.

   *  Filter Type: Identifies the type of filter, which also indicates
      whether the StartGroup/StartObject and EndGroup/EndObject fields
      will be present.

   *  StartGroup: The start Group ID.  Only present for "AbsoluteStart"
      and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

   *  StartObject: The start Object ID.  Only present for
      "AbsoluteStart" and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

   *  EndGroup: The end Group ID, inclusive.  Only present for the
      "AbsoluteRange" filter type.

   *  Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

   On successful subscription, the publisher MUST reply with a
   SUBSCRIBE_OK, allowing the subscriber to determine the start group/
   object when not explicitly specified and the publisher SHOULD start
   delivering objects.

   If a publisher cannot satisfy the requested start or end or if the
   end has already been published it SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR with
   code 'Invalid Range'.  A publisher MUST NOT send objects from outside
   the requested start and end.

6.5.  SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE

   A subscriber issues a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE to a publisher to request a
   change to a prior subscription.  Subscriptions can only become more
   narrower, not wider, because an attempt to widen a subscription could
   fail.  If Objects before the start or after the end of the current
   subscription are needed, a separate subscription can be made.  The
   start Object MUST NOT decrease and when it increases, there is no
   guarantee that a publisher will not have already sent Objects before
   the new start Object.  The end Object MUST NOT increase and when it
   decreases, there is no guarantee that a publisher will not have
   already sent Objects after the new end Object.  A publisher SHOULD
   close the Session as a 'Protocol Violation' if the SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE
   violates either rule or if the subscriber specifies a Subscribe ID
   that does not exist within the Session.

   Unlike a new subscription, SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE can not cause an Object
   to be delivered multiple times.  Like SUBSCRIBE, EndGroup and
   EndObject MUST specify the same or a later object than StartGroup and
   StartObject.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message {
     Type (i) = 0x2,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     StartGroup (i),
     StartObject (i),
     EndGroup (i),
     Subscriber Priority (8),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
   }

                  Figure 6: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The subscription identifier that is unique within
      the session.  This MUST match an existing Subscribe ID.

   *  StartGroup: The start Group ID.

   *  StartObject: The start Object ID.

   *  EndGroup: The end Group ID, plus 1.  A value of 0 means the
      subscription is open-ended.

   *  Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription
      relative to other subscriptions in the same session.  Lower
      numbers get higher priority.  See Section 4.

   *  Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

6.6.  UNSUBSCRIBE

   A subscriber issues a UNSUBSCRIBE message to a publisher indicating
   it is no longer interested in receiving media for the specified track
   and Objects should stop being sent as soon as possible.  The
   publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_DONE to acknowledge the unsubscribe was
   successful.

   The format of UNSUBSCRIBE is as follows:

   UNSUBSCRIBE Message {
     Type (i) = 0xA,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i)
   }

                     Figure 7: MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

6.7.  FETCH

   A subscriber issues a FETCH to a publisher to request a range of
   already published objects within a track.  The publisher responding
   to a FETCH is responsible for retrieving all available Objects.  If
   there are gaps between Objects, the publisher omits them from the
   fetch response.  All omitted objects have status Object Not
   Available.

   A publisher responds to a FETCH request with either a FETCH_OK or a
   FETCH_ERROR message.  If it responds with FETCH_OK, the publisher
   creates a new unidirectional stream that is used to send the Objects.
   A relay MAY start sending objects immediately in response to a FETCH,
   even if sending the FETCH_OK takes longer because it requires going
   upstream to populate the latest object.

   The Object Forwarding Preference does not apply to fetches.

   Fetch specifies an inclusive range of Objects starting at StartObject
   in StartGroup and ending at EndObject in EndGroup.  EndGroup and
   EndObject MUST specify the same or a later object than StartGroup and
   StartObject.

   The format of FETCH is as follows:

   FETCH Message {
     Type (i) = 0x16,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Track Name Length (i),
     Track Name (..),
     Subscriber Priority (8),
     Group Order (8),
     StartGroup (i),
     StartObject (i),
     EndGroup (i),
     EndObject (i),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Parameters (..) ...
   }

                        Figure 8: MOQT FETCH Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The Subscribe ID identifies a given fetch request.
      Subscribe ID is a variable length integer that MUST be unique and
      monotonically increasing within a session.

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined
      in (Section 2.4.1).

   *  Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in
      (Section 2.4.1).

   *  Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a fetch request
      relative to other subscriptions or fetches in the same session.
      Lower numbers get higher priority.  See Section 4.

   *  Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered
      in Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group.  See
      Section 4.  A value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's
      Group Order SHOULD be used.  Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol
      error.

   *  StartGroup: The start Group ID.

   *  StartObject: The start Object ID.

   *  EndGroup: The end Group ID.

   *  EndObject: The end Object ID, plus 1.  A value of 0 means the
      entire group is requested.

   *  Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

   Objects that are not yet published will not be retrieved by a FETCH.
   The latest available Object is indicated in the FETCH_OK, and is the
   last Object a fetch will return if the EndGroup and EndObject have
   not yet been published.

   A publisher MUST send fetched groups in the determined group order,
   either ascending or descending.  Within each group, objects are sent
   in Object ID order; subgroup ID is not used for ordering.

   If StartGroup/StartObject is greater than the latest published Object
   group, the publisher MUST return FETCH_ERROR with error code 'No
   Objects'.

   A publisher MUST send fetched groups in group order, either ascending
   or descending.  Within each group, objects are sent in Object ID
   order; subgroup ID is not used for ordering.

6.8.  FETCH_CANCEL

   A subscriber issues a FETCH_CANCEL message to a publisher indicating
   it is no longer interested in receiving Objects for the fetch
   specified by 'Subscribe ID'.  The publisher SHOULD close the
   unidirectional stream as soon as possible.

   The format of FETCH_CANCEL is as follows:

   FETCH_CANCEL Message {
     Type (i) = 0x17,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i)
   }

                    Figure 9: MOQT FETCH_CANCEL Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.7.

6.9.  ANNOUNCE_OK

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_OK control message to acknowledge
   the successful authorization and acceptance of an ANNOUNCE message.

   ANNOUNCE_OK Message
   {
     Type (i) = 0x7,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
   }

                    Figure 10: MOQT ANNOUNCE_OK Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the track namespace in the ANNOUNCE
      message for which this response is provided.

6.10.  ANNOUNCE_ERROR

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_ERROR control message for tracks
   that failed authorization.

   ANNOUNCE_ERROR Message
   {
     Type (i) = 0x8,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase (..),
   }

                   Figure 11: MOQT ANNOUNCE_ERROR Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies the track namespace in the ANNOUNCE
      message for which this response is provided.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for announcement
      failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for announcement error.

6.11.  ANNOUNCE_CANCEL

   The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL control message to indicate
   it will stop sending new subscriptions for tracks within the provided
   Track Namespace.

   If a publisher receives new subscriptions for that namespace after
   receiving an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL, it SHOULD close the session as a
   'Protocol Violation'.

   ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message {
     Type (i) = 0xC,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (..),
   }

                  Figure 12: MOQT ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.4.1).

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for canceling the
      announcement.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for announcement cancelation.

6.12.  TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST

   A potential subscriber sends a 'TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST' message on the
   control stream to obtain information about the current status of a
   given track.

   A TRACK_STATUS message MUST be sent in response to each
   TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST.

   TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST Message {
     Type (i) = 0xD,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Track Name Length (i),
     Track Name (..),
   }

                Figure 13: MOQT TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST Message

6.13.  SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES

   The subscriber sends the SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES control message to a
   publisher to request the current set of matching announcements, as
   well as future updates to the set.

   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES Message {
     Type (i) = 0x11,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace Prefix (tuple),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Parameters (..) ...,
   }

                Figure 14: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES Message

   *  Track Namespace Prefix: An ordered N-Tuple of byte fields which
      are matched against track namespaces known to the publisher.  For
      example, if the publisher is a relay that has received ANNOUNCE
      messages for namespaces ("example.com", "meeting=123",
      "participant=100") and ("example.com", "meeting=123",
      "participant=200"), a SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES for ("example.com",
      "meeting=123") would match both.  If an endpoint receives a Track
      Namespace Prefix tuple with an N of 0 or more than 32, it MUST
      close the session with a Protocol Violation.

   *  Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

   The publisher will respond with SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OK or
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR.  If the SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES is successful,
   the publisher will forward any matching ANNOUNCE messages to the
   subscriber that it has not yet sent.  If the set of matching ANNOUNCE
   messages changes, the publisher sends the corresponding ANNOUNCE or
   UNANNOUNCE message.

   A subscriber cannot make overlapping namespace subscriptions on a
   single session.  Within a session, if a publisher receives a
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES with a Track Namespace Prefix that is a prefix of
   an earlier SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES or vice versa, it MUST respond with
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR, with error code
   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OVERLAP.

   The publisher MUST ensure the subscriber is authorized to perform
   this namespace subscription.

   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES is not required for a publisher to send ANNOUNCE
   and UNANNOUNCE messages to a subscriber.  It is useful in
   applications or relays where subscribers are only interested in or
   authorized to access a subset of available announcements.

6.14.  UNSUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES

   A subscriber issues a UNSUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES message to a publisher
   indicating it is no longer interested in ANNOUNCE and UNANNOUNCE
   messages for the specified track namespace prefix.

   The format of UNSUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES is as follows:

   UNSUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES Message {
     Type (i) = 0x14,
     Length (i),

6.15.  SUBSCRIBE_OK

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_OK control message for successful
   subscriptions.

   SUBSCRIBE_OK
   {
     Type (i) = 0x4,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Expires (i),
     Group Order (8),
     ContentExists (8),
     [Largest Group ID (i)],
     [Largest Object ID (i)],
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
   }

                    Figure 16: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_OK Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Expires: Time in milliseconds after which the subscription is no
      longer valid.  A value of 0 indicates that the subscription does
      not expire or expires at an unknown time.  Expires is advisory and
      a subscription can end prior to the expiry time or last longer.

   *  Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
      Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group.  See
      Section 4.  Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol
      error.

   *  ContentExists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0
      if not.  If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID
      fields will not be present.  Any other value is a protocol error
      and MUST terminate the session with a Protocol Violation
      (Section 3.5).

   *  Largest Group ID: The largest Group ID available for this track.
      This field is only present if ContentExists has a value of 1.

   *  Largest Object ID: The largest Object ID available within the
      largest Group ID for this track.  This field is only present if
      ContentExists has a value of 1.

   *  Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

6.16.  SUBSCRIBE_ERROR

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR control message in response to a
   failed SUBSCRIBE.

   SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
   {
     Type (i) = 0x5,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase (..),
     Track Alias (i),
   }

                  Figure 17: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ERROR Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for subscription
      failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for subscription error.

   *  Track Alias: When Error Code is 'Retry Track Alias', the
      subscriber SHOULD re-issue the SUBSCRIBE with this Track Alias
      instead.  If this Track Alias is already in use, the subscriber
      MUST close the connection with a Duplicate Track Alias error
      (Section 3.5).

6.17.  FETCH_OK

   A publisher sends a FETCH_OK control message in response to
   successful fetches.  A publisher MAY send Objects in response to a
   FETCH before the FETCH_OK message is sent, but the FETCH_OK MUST NOT
   be sent until the latest group and object are known.

   FETCH_OK
   {
     Type (i) = 0x18,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Group Order (8),
     End Of Track (8),
     Largest Group ID (i),
     Largest Object ID (i),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
   }

                      Figure 18: MOQT FETCH_OK Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Fetch Identifier as defined in Section 6.7.

   *  Group Order: Indicates the fetch will be delivered in Ascending
      (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group.  See Section 4.  Values
      of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

   *  End Of Track: 1 if all objects have been published on this track,
      so the Largest Group ID and Object Id indicate the last Object in
      the track, 0 if not.

   *  Largest Group ID: The largest Group ID available for this track.
      This field is only present if ContentExists has a value of 1.

   *  Largest Object ID: The largest Object ID available within the
      largest Group ID for this track.  This field is only present if
      ContentExists has a value of 1.

   *  Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

6.18.  FETCH_ERROR

   A publisher sends a FETCH_ERROR control message in response to a
   failed FETCH.

   FETCH_ERROR
   {
     Type (i) = 0x19,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase (..),
   }

                    Figure 19: MOQT FETCH_ERROR Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription Identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for fetch failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for fetch error.

6.19.  SUBSCRIBE_DONE

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_DONE message to indicate it is done
   publishing Objects for that subscription.  The Status Code indicates
   why the subscription ended, and whether it was an error.  Because
   SUBSCRIBE_DONE is sent on the control stream, it is likely to arrive
   at the receiver before late-arriving objects, and often even late-
   opening streams.  However, the receiver uses it as an indication that
   it should receive any late-opening streams in a relatively short
   time.

   Note that some objects in the subscribed track might never be
   delivered, because a stream was reset, or never opened in the first
   place, due to the delivery timeout.

   A sender MUST NOT send SUBSCRIBE_DONE until it has closed all streams
   it will ever open, and has no further datagrams to send, for a
   subscription.  After sending SUBSCRIBE_DONE, the sender can
   immediately destroy subscription state, although stream state can
   persist until delivery completes.  The sender might persist
   subscription state to enforce the delivery timeout by resetting
   streams on which it has already sent FIN, only deleting it when all
   such streams have received ACK of the FIN.

   A sender MUST NOT destroy subscription state until it sends
   SUBSCRIBE_DONE, though it can choose to stop sending objects (and
   thus send SUBSCRIBE_DONE) for any reason.

   A subscriber that receives SUBSCRIBE_DONE SHOULD set a timer of at
   least its delivery timeout in case some objects are still inbound due
   to prioritization or packet loss.  The subscriber MAY dispense with a
   timer if it sent UNSUBSCRIBE or is otherwise no longer interested in
   objects from the track.  Once the timer has expired, the receiver
   destroys subscription state once all open streams for the
   subscription have closed.  A subscriber MAY discard subscription
   state earlier, at the cost of potentially not delivering some late
   objects to the application.  The subscriber SHOULD send STOP_SENDING
   on all streams related to the subscription when it deletes
   subscription state.

   The format of SUBSCRIBE_DONE is as follows:

   SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message {
     Type (i) = 0xB,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
     Status Code (i),
     Stream Count (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase (..),
   }

                   Figure 20: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message

   *  Subscribe ID: Subscription identifier as defined in Section 6.4.

   *  Status Code: An integer status code indicating why the
      subscription ended.

   *  Stream Count: An integer indicating the number of data streams the
      publisher opened for this subscription.  The subscriber can remove
      all subscription state once the same number of streams have been
      processed.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for subscription error.

6.20.  MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID

   A publisher sends a MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID message to increase the number
   of subscriptions a subscriber can create within a session.

   The Maximum Subscribe Id MUST only increase within a session, and
   receipt of a MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID message with an equal or smaller
   Subscribe ID value is a 'Protocol Violation'.

   MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID
   {
     Type (i) = 0x15,
     Length (i),
     Subscribe ID (i),
   }

                  Figure 21: MOQT MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID Message

   *  Subscribe ID: The new Maximum Subscribe ID for the session.  If a
      Subscribe ID Section 6.4 equal or larger than this is received by
      the publisher that sent the MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID, the publisher MUST
      close the session with an error of 'Too Many Subscribes'.

6.21.  SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED

   The SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED message is sent when a subscriber would like
   to begin a new subscription, but cannot because the Subscribe ID
   would exceed the Maximum Subscribe ID value sent by the peer.  The
   subscriber SHOULD send only one SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED for a given
   Maximum Subscribe ID.

   A publisher MAY send a MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID upon receipt of
   SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED, but it MUST NOT rely on SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED to
   trigger sending a MAX_SUBSCRIBE_ID, because sending
   SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED is not required.

   SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED
   {
     Type (i) = 0x1A,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Subscribe ID (i),
   }

                 Figure 22: MOQT SUBSCRIBES_BLOCKED Message

   *  Maximum Subscribe ID: The Maximum Subscribe ID for the session on
      which the subscriber is blocked.  More on Subscribe ID in
      Section 6.4.

6.22.  ANNOUNCE

   The publisher sends the ANNOUNCE control message to advertise where
   the receiver can route SUBSCRIBEs for tracks within the announced
   Track Namespace.  The receiver verifies the publisher is authorized
   to publish tracks under this namespace.

   ANNOUNCE Message {
     Type (i) = 0x6,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Number of Parameters (i),
     Parameters (..) ...,
   }

                      Figure 23: MOQT ANNOUNCE Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.4.1)

   *  Parameters: The parameters are defined in Section 6.1.1.

6.23.  UNANNOUNCE

   The publisher sends the UNANNOUNCE control message to indicate its
   intent to stop serving new subscriptions for tracks within the
   provided Track Namespace.

   UNANNOUNCE Message {
     Type (i) = 0x9,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
   }

                     Figure 24: MOQT UNANNOUNCE Message

   *  Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
      (Section 2.4.1).

6.24.  TRACK_STATUS

   A publisher sends a 'TRACK_STATUS' message on the control stream in
   response to a TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST message.

   TRACK_STATUS Message {
     Type (i) = 0xE,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace (tuple),
     Track Name Length(i),
     Track Name (..),
     Status Code (i),
     Last Group ID (i),
     Last Object ID (i),
   }

                    Figure 25: MOQT TRACK_STATUS Message

   The 'Status Code' field provides additional information about the
   status of the track.  It MUST hold one of the following values.  Any
   other value is a malformed message.

   0x00: The track is in progress, and subsequent fields contain the
   highest group and object ID for that track.

   0x01: The track does not exist.  Subsequent fields MUST be zero, and
   any other value is a malformed message.

   0x02: The track has not yet begun.  Subsequent fields MUST be zero.
   Any other value is a malformed message.

   0x03: The track has finished, so there is no "live edge."  Subsequent
   fields contain the highest Group and object ID known.

   0x04: The publisher is a relay that cannot obtain the current track
   status from upstream.  Subsequent fields contain the largest group
   and object ID known.

   Any other value in the Status Code field is a malformed message.

   When a relay is subscribed to a track, it can simply return the
   highest group and object ID it has observed, whether or not that
   object was cached or completely delivered.  If not subscribed, a
   relay SHOULD send a TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST upstream to obtain updated
   information.

   Alternatively, the relay MAY subscribe to the track to obtain the
   same information.

   If a relay cannot or will not do either, it should return its best
   available information with status code 0x04.

   The receiver of multiple TRACK_STATUS messages for a track uses the
   information from the latest arriving message, as they are delivered
   in order on a single stream.

6.25.  SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OK

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OK control message for
   successful namespace subscriptions.

   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OK
   {
     Type (i) = 0x12,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace Prefix (tuple),
   }

               Figure 26: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_OK Message

   *  Track Namespace Prefix: As defined in Section 6.13.

6.26.  SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR

   A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR control message in
   response to a failed SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES.

   SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR
   {
     Type (i) = 0x13,
     Length (i),
     Track Namespace Prefix (tuple),
     Error Code (i),
     Reason Phrase Length (i),
     Reason Phrase (..),
   }

             Figure 27: MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ANNOUNCES_ERROR Message

   *  Track Namespace Prefix: As defined in Section 6.13.

   *  Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for the namespace
      subscription failure.

   *  Reason Phrase: Provides the reason for the namespace subscription
      error.

7.  Data Streams

   A publisher sends Objects matching a subscription on Data Streams.

   All unidirectional MOQT streams start with a variable-length integer
   indicating the type of the stream in question.

             +=====+========================================+
             |  ID | Type                                   |
             +=====+========================================+
             | 0x4 | STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP (Section 7.4.1) |
             +-----+----------------------------------------+
             | 0x5 | FETCH_HEADER (Section 7.4.3)           |
             +-----+----------------------------------------+

                                 Table 5

   All MOQT datagrams start with a variable-length integer indicating
   the type of the datagram.

              +=====+======================================+
              |  ID | Type                                 |
              +=====+======================================+
              | 0x1 | OBJECT_DATAGRAM (Section 7.2)        |
              +-----+--------------------------------------+
              | 0x2 | OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS (Section 7.2) |
              +-----+--------------------------------------+

                                 Table 6

   An endpoint that receives an unknown stream or datagram type MUST
   close the session.

   Every Track has a single 'Object Forwarding Preference' and the
   Original Publisher MUST NOT mix different forwarding preferences
   within a single track.  If a subscriber receives different forwarding
   preferences for a track, it SHOULD close the session with an error of
   'Protocol Violation'.

7.1.  Object Headers

   An OBJECT message contains a range of contiguous bytes from from the
   specified track, as well as associated metadata required to deliver,
   cache, and forward it.  Objects are sent by publishers.

7.1.1.  Canonical Object Fields

   A canonical MoQ Object has the following information:

   *  Track Namespace and Track Name: The track this object belongs to.

   *  Group ID: The object is a member of the indicated group ID
      Section 2.3 within the track.

   *  Object ID: The order of the object within the group.  The IDs
      starts at 0, increasing sequentially for each object within the
      group.

   *  Publisher Priority: An 8 bit integer indicating the publisher's
      priority for the Object Section 4.

   *  Object Forwarding Preference: An enumeration indicating how a
      publisher sends an object.  The preferences are Track, Subgroup,
      and Datagram.  An Object MUST be sent according to its Object
      Forwarding Preference, described below.

   *  Subgroup ID: The object is a member of the indicated subgroup ID
      (Section 2.2) within the group.  This field is omitted if the
      Object Forwarding Preference is Track or Datagram.

   *  Object Status: As enumeration used to indicate missing objects or
      mark the end of a group or track.  See Section 7.1.1.1 below.

   *  Object Payload: An opaque payload intended for an End Subscriber
      and SHOULD NOT be processed by a relay.  Only present when 'Object
      Status' is Normal (0x0).

7.1.1.1.  Object Status

   The Object Status informs subscribers what objects will not be
   received because they were never produced, are no longer available,
   or because they are beyond the end of a group or track.

   Status can have following values:

   *  0x0 := Normal object.  The payload is array of bytes and can be
      empty.

   *  0x1 := Indicates Object does not exist.  Indicates that this
      object does not exist at any publisher and it will not be
      published in the future.  This SHOULD be cached.

   *  0x3 := Indicates end of Group.  ObjectId is one greater that the
      largest object produced in the group identified by the GroupID.
      This is sent right after the last object in the group.  If the
      ObjectID is 0, it indicates there are no Objects in this Group.
      This SHOULD be cached.  A publisher MAY use an end of Group object
      to signal the end of all open Subgroups in a Group.

   *  0x4 := Indicates end of Track and Group.  GroupID is the largest
      group produced in this track and the ObjectId is one greater than
      the largest object produced in that group.  An object with this
      status that has a Group ID less than any other Group ID, or an
      Object ID less than or equal to the largest in the group, is a
      protocol error, and the receiver MUST terminate the session.  This
      SHOULD be cached.

   *  0x5 := Indicates end of Track.  GroupID is one greater than the
      largest group produced in this track and the ObjectId is zero.  An
      object with this status that has a Group ID less than or equal to
      any other Group ID, or an Object ID other than zero, is a protocol
      error, and the receiver MUST terminate the session.  This SHOULD
      be cached.

   Any other value SHOULD be treated as a protocol error and terminate
   the session with a Protocol Violation (Section 3.5).  Any object with
   a status code other than zero MUST have an empty payload.

   Though some status information could be inferred from QUIC stream
   state, that information is not reliable and cacheable.

7.2.  Object Datagram Message

   An OBJECT_DATAGRAM message carries a single object in a datagram.

   An Object received in an OBJECT_DATAGRAM message has an Object
   Forwarding Preference = Datagram.  To send an Object with Object
   Forwarding Preference = Datagram, determine the length of the header
   and payload and send the Object as datagram.  In certain scenarios
   where the object size can be larger than maximum datagram size for
   the session, the Object will be dropped.

   OBJECT_DATAGRAM Message {
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Publisher Priority (8),
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                  Figure 28: MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM Message

   There is no explicit length field.  The entirety of the transport
   datagram following Publisher Priority contains the Object Payload.

7.3.  Object Datagram Status Message

   An OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS message is similar to OBEJCT_DATAGRAM
   except it conveys an Object Status and has no payload.

   OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS Message {
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Publisher Priority (8),
     Object Status (i),
   }

               Figure 29: MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS Message

7.4.  Streams

   When objects are sent on streams, the stream begins with a stream
   header message and is followed by one or more sets of serialized
   object fields.  If a stream ends gracefully in the middle of a
   serialized Object, terminate the session with a Protocol Violation.

   A publisher SHOULD NOT open more than one stream at a time with the
   same stream header message type and fields.

   TODO: figure out how a relay closes these streams

7.4.1.  Stream Header Subgroup

   When a stream begins with STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP, all objects on the
   stream belong to the track requested in the Subscribe message
   identified by Track Alias and the subgroup indicated by 'Group ID'
   and Subgroup ID.

   STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP Message {
     Track Alias (i),
     Group ID (i),
     Subgroup ID (i),
     Publisher Priority (8),
   }

               Figure 30: MOQT STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP Message

   All Objects received on a stream opened with STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP
   have an Object Forwarding Preference = Subgroup.

   To send an Object with Object Forwarding Preference = Subgroup, find
   the open stream that is associated with the subscription, Group ID
   and Subgroup ID, or open a new one and send the
   STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP.  Then serialize the following fields.

   The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is
   zero.

   {
     Object ID (i),
     Object Payload Length (i),
     [Object Status (i)],
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                 Figure 31: MOQT Group Stream Object Fields

   A publisher MUST NOT send an Object on a stream if its Object ID is
   less than a previously sent Object ID within a given group in that
   stream.

7.4.2.  Closing Subgroup Streams

   Subscribers will often need to know if they have received all objects
   in a Subgroup, particularly if they serve as a relay or cache.  QUIC
   and Webtransport streams provide signals that can be used for this
   purpose.  Closing Subgroups promptly frees system resources and often
   unlocks flow control credit to open more streams.

   If a sender has delivered all objects in a Subgroup to the QUIC
   stream, except any objects before the beginning of a subscription, it
   MUST close the stream with a FIN.

   If a sender closes the stream before delivering all such objects to
   the QUIC stream, it MUST use a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT
   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset] frame.  This includes an
   open Subgroup exceeding its Delivery Timeout, early termination of
   subscription due to an UNSUBSCRIBE message, a publisher's decision to
   end the subscription early, or a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE moving the end of
   the subscription to before the current Group or the start after the
   current Group.  When RESET_STREAM_AT is used, the reliable_size
   SHOULD include the stream header so the receiver can identify the
   corresponding subscription and accurately account for reset data
   streams when handling SUBSCRIBE_DONE (see Section 6.19).  Publishers
   that reset data streams without using RESET_STREAM_AT with an
   appropriate reliable_size can cause subscribers to hold on to
   subscription state until a timeout expires.

   A sender might send all objects in a Subgroup and the FIN on a QUIC
   stream, and then reset the stream.  In this case, the receiving
   application would receive the FIN if and only if all objects were
   received.  If the application receives all data on the stream and the
   FIN, it can ignore any RESET_STREAM it receives.

   If a sender will not deliver any objects from a Subgroup, it MAY send
   a STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP on a new stream, with no objects, and then
   send RESET_STREAM_AT with a reliable_size equal to the length of the
   stream header.  This explicitly tells the receiver there is an unsent
   Subgroup.

   Since SUBSCRIBEs always end on a group boundary, an ending
   subscription can always cleanly close all its subgroups.  A sender
   that terminates a stream early for any other reason (e.g., to handoff
   to a different sender) MUST use RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT.
   Senders SHOULD terminate a stream on Group boundaries to avoid doing
   so.

   An MoQT implementation that processes a stream FIN is assured it has
   received all objects in a subgroup from the start of the
   subscription.  If a relay, it can forward stream FINs to its own
   subscribers once those objects have been sent.  A relay MAY treat
   receipt of EndOfGroup, GroupDoesNotExist, or EndOfTrack objects as a
   signal to close corresponding streams even if the FIN has not
   arrived, as further objects on the stream would be a protocol
   violation.

   Similarly, an EndOfGroup message indicates the maximum Object ID in
   the Group, so if all Objects in the Group have been received, a FIN
   can be sent on any stream where the entire subgroup has been sent.
   This might be complex to implement.

   Processing a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT means that there might
   be other objects in the Subgroup beyond the last one received.  A
   relay might immediately reset the corresponding downstream stream, or
   it might attempt to recover the missing Objects in an effort send all
   the objects in the subgroups and the FIN.  It also might send
   RESET_STREAM_AT with reliable_size set to the last object it has, so
   as to reliably deliver the objects it has while signaling that other
   objects might exist.

   A subscriber MAY send a QUIC STOP_SENDING frame for a subgroup stream
   if the Group or Subgroup is no longer of interest to it.  The
   publisher SHOULD respond with RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT.  If
   RESET_STREAM_AT is sent, note that the receiver has indicated no
   interest in the objects, so setting a reliable_size beyond the stream
   header is of questionable utility.

   RESET_STREAM and STOP_SENDING on SUBSCRIBE data streams have no
   impact on other Subgroups in the Group or the subscription, although
   applications might cancel all Subgroups in a Group at once.

7.4.3.  Fetch Header

   When a stream begins with FETCH_HEADER, all objects on the stream
   belong to the track requested in the Fetch message identified by
   Subscribe ID.

   FETCH_HEADER Message {
     Subscribe ID (i),
   }

                    Figure 32: MOQT FETCH_HEADER Message

   Each object sent on a fetch stream after the FETCH_HEADER has the
   following format:

   {
     Group ID (i),
     Subgroup ID (i),
     Object ID (i),
     Publisher Priority (8),
     Object Payload Length (i),
     [Object Status (i)],
     Object Payload (..),
   }

                    Figure 33: MOQT Fetch Object Fields

   The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is
   zero.

   The Subgroup ID field of an object with a Forwarding Preference of
   "Datagram" (see Section 7.1.1) is set to the Object ID.

7.5.  Examples

   Sending a track on one stream:

   STREAM_HEADER_TRACK {
     Track Alias = 1
     Publisher Priority = 0
   }
   {
     Group ID = 0
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "abcd"
   }
   {
     Group ID = 1
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "efgh"
   }

   Sending a subgroup on one stream:

   Stream = 2

   STREAM_HEADER_SUBGROUP {
     Track Alias = 2
     Group ID = 0
     Subgroup ID = 0
     Publisher Priority = 0
   }
   {
     Object ID = 0
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "abcd"
   }
   {
     Object ID = 1
     Object Payload Length = 4
     Payload = "efgh"
   }

8.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Expand this section, including subscriptions.

8.1.  Resource Exhaustion

   Live content requires significant bandwidth and resources.  Failure
   to set limits will quickly cause resource exhaustion.

   MOQT uses stream limits and flow control to impose resource limits at
   the network layer.  Endpoints SHOULD set flow control limits based on
   the anticipated bitrate.

   Endpoints MAY impose a MAX STREAM count limit which would restrict
   the number of concurrent streams which a MOQT Streaming Format could
   have in flight.

   The publisher prioritizes and transmits streams out of order.
   Streams might be starved indefinitely during congestion.  The
   publisher and subscriber MUST cancel a stream, preferably the lowest
   priority, after reaching a resource limit.

8.2.  Timeouts

   Implementations are advised to use timeouts to prevent resource
   exhaustion attacks by a peer that does not send expected data within
   an expected time.  Each implementation is expected to set its own
   limits.

9.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: fill out currently missing registries:

   *  MOQT version numbers

   *  Setup parameters

   *  Subscribe parameters

   *  Subscribe Error codes

   *  Subscribe Namespace Error codes

   *  Announce Error codes

   *  Announce Cancel Reason codes

   *  Message types

   TODO: register the URI scheme and the ALPN
