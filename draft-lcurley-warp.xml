    <abstract>


<t>This document defines the core behavior for Warp, a segmented live media transport protocol.
Media is split into segments based on the underlying media encoding.
Each segment is transmitted independently over a QUIC stream.
QUIC streams are prioritized, allowing less important segments to be starved or dropped during congestion.</t>

<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

<section anchor="latency" title="Latency">
<t>In a perfect world, we could deliver live media at the same rate it is produced.
The end-to-end latency of a broadcast would be fixed and only subject to encoding and transmission delays.
Unfortunately, networks have variable throughput, primarily due to congestion.</t>

<t>Attempting to deliver media larger than this variable network bitrate causes queuing.
This queuing can occur anywhere in the path between the encoder and decoder.
For example: the application, the OS socket, a wifi router, within an ISP, or generally anywhere in transit.</t>

<t>If nothing is done, new frames will be appended to the end of a growing queue and will take longer to arrive than their predecessors, increasing latency.
Our job is to minimize the growth of this queue, and failing that, skip the queue when possible.</t>

<t>Thus speed at which a media protocol can detect and respond to queuing determines the latency.
We can generally classify existing media protocols into two categories based on the underlying network protocol:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>TCP-based media protocols (ex. RTMP, HLS, DASH) are popular due to their simplicity.
Media is served/consumed in decode order while any networking is handled by the TCP layer.
However, these protocols primarily see use at higher latency targets due to their relatively slow detection and response to queuing.</t>
  <t>UDP-based media protocols (ex. RTP, WebRTC, SRT) can side-step the issues with TCP and provide lower latency with better queue management.
However the media protocol is now responsible for fragmentation, congestion control, retransmissions, receiver feedback, reassembly, and more.
This added complexity significantly raises the implementation difficulty and hurts interoperability.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A goal of this draft is to get the best of both worlds: a simple protocol that can still rapidly detect and respond to congestion.
This is possible emergence of QUIC, designed to fix the shortcomings of TCP.
This draft relies on QUIC streams to deliver media segments in priority order during congestion.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="universal" title="Universal">
<t>The media protocol ecosystem is fragmented; each protocol has it's own niche.
Specialization is often a good thing, but we believe there's enough overlap to warrant consolidation.</t>

<t>For example, a service might simultaneously ingest via WebRTC, SRT, RTMP, and/or a custom UDP protocol depending on the broadcaster.
The same service might then simultaneously distribute via WebRTC, LL-HLS, HLS, (or the DASH variants) and/or a custom UDP protocol depending on the viewer.</t>

<t>These media protocols are radically different and not interoperable; requiring transcoding or transmuxing.
This cost is further increased by the need to maintain separate stacks with different expertise requirements.</t>

<t>A goal of this draft is to cover a large spectrum of use-cases. Specifically:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Consolidated contribution and distribution.
The primary difference between the two is the ability to fanout.
How does a CDN know how to forward media to N consumers and how does it reduce the encoded bitrate during congestion?
A single protocol can cover both use-cases provided intermediaries are informed on how to forward and drop media.</t>
  <t>A configurable latency versus quality trade-off.
The producer (broadcaster) chooses how to encode and transmit media based on the desired user experience.
Each consumer (viewer) chooses how long to wait for media based on their desired user experience and network.
We want an experience that can vary from real-time and lossy for one viewer, to delayed and loss-less for another viewer, without separate encodings or protocols.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="intermediaries" title="Intermediaries">
<t>The prevailing belief is that UDP-based protocols are more expensive and don't "scale".
While it's true that UDP is more difficult to optimize than TCP, QUIC itself is proof that it is is possible to reach performance parity.
In fact even some TCP-based protocols (ex. RTMP) don't "scale" either and are exclusively used for contribution as a result.</t>

<t>The truth is that the ability to scale a media protocol depends on intermediary support: proxies, caches, CDNs, SFUs, etc.
The success of HTTP-based media protocols is due to the ability to leverage traditional HTTP CDNs.</t>

<t>Meanwhile, it's difficult to build a CDN for media protocols that were not designed with intermediaries in mind.
For example, an intermediary has to parse the underlying codec to determine which RTP packets should be dropped first, and the decision is not deterministic or consistent for each hop.</t>

<t>A goal of this draft is to treat intermediaries as first class citizens.
Any identification, reliability, ordering, prioritization, caching, etc is written to the wire in header designed for intermediaries.
This ensures that intermediaries can easily route/fanout media to the final destination.
This also ensures that congestion response is consistent at every hop based on the preferences of the media producer.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="segments" title="Segments">
<t>Warp works by splitting media into segments that can be transferred over the network somewhat independently.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The encoder determines how to fragment the encoded bitstream into segments (<xref target="media"/>).</t>
  <t>Segments are assigned an intended delivery order that should be obeyed during congestion (<xref target="delivery-order"/>)</t>
  <t>The decoder receives each segment and skips any segments that do not arrive in time (<xref target="decoder"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="media" title="Media">
<t>An encoder produces one or more codec bitstreams for each track.
The bitstreams are fed to the decoder on the other end, after being transported over the network, in the same order its produced.
The problem, as explained in motivation (<xref target="latency"/>), is that networks cannot sustain a continuous rate and thus queuing occurs.
See the appendix for an overview of media encoding (<xref target="appendix.encoding"/>).</t>

<t>Warp works by fragmenting the bitstream into segments that can be transmitted independently.
Depending on how the segments are fragmented, the decoder has the ability to safely drop media during congestion.
See the appendix for fragmentation examples (<xref target="appendix.examples"/>)</t>

<t>A segment:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MUST contain a single track.</t>
  <t>MUST be in decode order. This means an increasing DTS.</t>
  <t>MAY contain any number of frames/samples.</t>
  <t>MAY have gaps between frames/samples.</t>
  <t>MAY overlap with other segments. This means interleaved timestamps.</t>
  <t>MAY reference frames in other segments, but only if listed as a dependency.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Segments are encoded using fragmented MP4 <xref target="ISOBMFF"/>.
This is necessary to store timestamps and various metadata depending on the codec.
A future draft of Warp may specify other container formats.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="delivery-order" title="Delivery Order">
<t>Media is produced with an intended order, both in terms of when media should be presented (PTS) and when media should be decoded (DTS).
As stated in motivation (<xref target="latency"/>), the network is unable to maintain this ordering during congestion without increasing latency.</t>

<t>Warp responds to congestion by assigning each segment a numeric delivery order.
The delivery order SHOULD be followed when possible to ensure that the most important media is delivered when throughput is limited.
Note that the contents within each segment are still delivered in order; this delivery order only applies to the ordering between segments.</t>

<t>The encoder determines the value assigned to each segment based the media encoding and desired user experience.
Multiple segments MAY use the same value, in which case they SHOULD be delivered via round-robin.
See the appendix for examples (<xref target="appendix.examples"/>).</t>

<t>A sender SHOULD attempt to deliver segments based on this delivery order.
This effectively involves creating a priority queue in ascending order, allocating any avaiable bandwidth to the next pending segment.
Since each segment is sent over a dedicated QUIC stream, the next QUIC packet SHOULD contain a STREAM frame for the next pending segment, repeated until the congestion window is hit.
The sender MAY ignore the delivery order for retransmits and MUST ignore it when flow control limits are reached.</t>

<t>A receiver MUST NOT assume that segments will be received in delivery order for a number of reasons:
* Newly encoded segments MAY have a smaller delivery order than outstanding segments.
* Packet loss or flow control MAY delay the delivery of individual streams.
* The sender might not support QUIC stream prioritization.</t>

<t>Segments arrive in delivery order, but media usually needs to be processed in decode order.
The decoder SHOULD use a buffer to reassmble segments into decode order and it SHOULD skip segments after a configurable duration.
The amount of time the decoder is willing to wait for a segment (buffer duration) is what ultimately determines the latency.</t>

<t>A proxy MAY change the delivery order, in which case it SHOULD update the value on the wire for future hops.
This is NOT RECOMMENDED unless the proxy knows additional information about the media.
For example, a proxy could use the PTS as the delivery order to enable head-of-line blocking for content that should not be skipped, like an advertisement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="decoder" title="Decoder">
<t>The decoder will receive multiple segments in parallel.
The decoder MUST synchronize segments using presentation timestamps within the bitstream.
The decoder SHOULD use a buffer to reorder frames/samples from separate segments into decode order.</t>

<t>Segments are NOT REQUIRED to be aligned.
A decoder MUST be prepared to skip over any gaps between segments.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="quic" title="QUIC">

<section anchor="establishment" title="Establishment">
<t>A connection is established using WebTransport <xref target="WebTransport"/>.</t>

<t>To summarize:
The client issues a HTTP CONNECT request with the intention of establishing a new WebTransport session.
The server returns an 200 OK response if the WebTransport session has been established, or an error status otherwise.</t>

<t>A WebTransport session exposes the basic QUIC service abstractions.
Specifically, either endpoint may create independent streams which are reliably delivered in order until canceled.</t>

<t>WebTransport can currently operate via HTTP/3 and HTTP/2, using QUIC or TCP under the hood respectively.
As mentioned in the motivation (<xref target="motivation"/>) section, TCP introduces head-of-line blocking and will result in a worse experience.
It is RECOMMENDED to use WebTransport over HTTP/3.</t>

<t>The application SHOULD use the CONNECT request for authentication and negotiation.
For example, including a authentication token and some identifier in the path.
The application MAY use QUIC streams for more complicated behavior.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="streams" title="Streams">
<t>Warp endpoints communicate over unidirectional QUIC streams.
The application MAY use bidirectional QUIC streams for other purposes.</t>

<t>A stream consists of sequential messages.
See messages (<xref target="messages"/>) for the list of messages and their encoding.
These are similar to QUIC and HTTP/3 frames, but called messages to avoid the media terminology.</t>

<t>Each stream MUST start with a <spanx style="verb">HEADERS</spanx> message that indicates how the stream should be transmitted.</t>

<t>Messages SHOULD be sent over the same stream if ordering is desired.
For example, <spanx style="verb">PAUSE</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">PLAY</spanx> messages SHOULD be sent on the same stream to avoid a race.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="prioritization" title="Prioritization">
<t>Warp utilizes stream prioritization to deliver the most important content during congestion.</t>

<t>The media producer SHOULD assign a numeric order to each stream, as contained in the HEADERS message (<xref target="headers"/>).
This is a strict prioritization scheme, such that any available bandwidth is allocated to streams in ascending order.
The delivery order is determined at encode, written to the wire so it can be read by intermediaries, and will not be updated.
This effectively creates a priority queue that can be maintained over multiple hops.</t>

<t>QUIC supports stream prioritization but does not standardize any mechanisms; see Section 2.3 in <xref target="QUIC"/>.
QUIC libraries will need to expose a API to the application to set the priority of each stream.</t>

<t>Senders SHOULD support prioritized streams, although it is OPTIONAL on a path with no expected congestion.
Senders SHOULD use strict ordering, although relative weights MAY be acceptable if there are no other options.
Senders MUST obey the order as written to the wire.
Senders MAY choose to delay retransmitting lower priority streams when possible within QUIC flow control limits.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cancellation" title="Cancellation">
<t>QUIC streams can be canceled by either endpoint with an error code.</t>

<t>When using <spanx style="verb">order</spanx>, lower priority streams will be starved during congestion, perhaps indefinitely.
These streams will consume resources and flow control until they are canceled.
When nearing resource limits, an endpoint SHOULD cancel the lowest priority stream with error code 0.</t>

<t>When using <spanx style="verb">expires</spanx>, a stream SHOULD be canceled after the duration has elapsed.
This is not a full replacement for prioritization, but can provide some congestion response by clearing parts of the queue.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="congestion-control" title="Congestion Control">
<t>As covered in the motivation section (<xref target="motivation"/>), the ability to prioritize or cancel streams is a form of congestion response.
It's equally important to detect congestion via congestion control, which is handled in the QUIC layer <xref target="QUIC-RECOVERY"/>.</t>

<t>Bufferbloat is caused by routers queueing packets for an indefinite amount of time rather than drop them.
This latency significantly reduces the ability for the application to prioritize or drop media in response to congestion.
Senders SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm that reduces this bufferbloat (ex. <xref target="BBR"/>).
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use a loss-based algorithm (ex. <xref target="NewReno"/>) unless the network fully supports ECN.</t>

<t>Live media is application-limited, which means that the encoder determines the max bitrate rather than the network.
Most TCP congestion control algorithms will only increase the congestion window if it is full, limiting the upwards mobility when application-limited.
Senders SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm that is designed for application-limited flows (ex. GCC).
Senders MAY periodically pad the connection with QUIC PING frames to fill the congestion window.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="termination" title="Termination">
<t>The QUIC connection can be terminated at any point with an error code.</t>

<t>The media producer MAY terminate the QUIC connection with an error code of 0 to indicate the clean termination of the broadcast.
The application SHOULD use a non-zero error code to indicate a fatal error.</t>

<section anchor="appendix.encoding" title="Appendix A. Video Encoding">
<t>In order to transport media, we first need to know how media is encoded.
This section is an overview of media encoding.</t>

<section anchor="tracks" title="Tracks">
<t>A broadcast consists of one or more tracks.
Each track has a type (audio, video, caption, etc) and uses a cooresponding codec.
There may be multiple tracks, including of the same type for a number of reasons.</t>

<t>For example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A track for each codec.</t>
  <t>A track for each resolution and bitrate.</t>
  <t>A track for each language.</t>
  <t>A track for each camera feed.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Tracks can be muxed together into a single container or stream.
The goal of Warp is to independently deliver tracks, and even parts of a track, so this is not allowed.
Each Warp segment MUST contain a single track.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="appendix.init" title="Init">
<t>Media codecs have a wide array of configuration options.
For example, the resolution, the color space, the features enabled, etc.</t>

<t>Before playback can begin, the decoder needs to know how the configuration.
This is done via a short payload at the very start of the media file.
The initialization payload can be cached and reused between segments with the same configuration.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="appendix.video" title="Video">
<t>Video is a sequence of pictures (frames) with a presentation timestamp (PTS).</t>

<t>An I-frame is a frame with no dependencies and is effectively an image file.
These frames are usually inserted at a frequent interval to support seeking or joining a live stream.
However they can also improve compression when used at hard scene cuts.</t>

<t>A P-frame is a frame that references on one or more earlier frames.
These frames are delta-encoded, such that they only encode the changes (typically motion).
This result in a massive file size reduction for most content outside of few notorious cases (ex. confetti).</t>

<t>A common encoding structure is to only reference the previous frame, as it is simple and minimizes latency:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 I <- P <- P <- P   I <- P <- P <- P   I <- P ...
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>There is no such thing as an optimal encoding structure.
Encoders tuned for the best quality will produce a tangled spaghetti of references.
Encoders tuned for the lowest latency can avoid reference frames to allow more to be dropped.</t>

<section anchor="appendix.b-frame" title="B-Frames">
<t>The goal of video codecs is to maximize compression.
One of the improvements is to allow a frame to reference later frames.</t>

<t>A B-frame is a frame that can reference one or more frames in the future, and any number of frames in the past.
These frames are more difficult to encode/decode as they require buffering and reordering.</t>

<t>A common encoding structure is to use B-frames in a fixed pattern.
Such a fixed pattern is not optimal, but it's simpler for hardware encoding:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    B     B         B     B         B
   / \   / \       / \   / \       / \
  v   v v   v     v   v v   v     v   v
 I <-- P <-- P   I <-- P <-- P   I <-- P ...
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The encoder outputs the bitstream in decode order, which means that each frame is output after its references.
This makes it easier for the decoder as all references are earlier in the bitstream and can be decoded immediately.</t>

<t>However, this causes problems with B-frames because they depend on a future frame, and some reordering has to occur.
In order to keep track of this, frames have a decode timestamp (DTS) in addition to a presentation timestamp (PTS).
A B-frame will have higher DTS value that its dependencies, while PTS and DTS will be the same for other frame types.</t>

<t>For the example above, this would look like:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
PTS: I B P B P I B P B P B
DTS: I   PB  PBI   PB  PB
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>B-frames add latency because of this reordering so they are usually not used for conversational latency.</t>

<t>Some codecs support scalable video coding (SVC), in which the encoder produces multiple bitstreams in a hierarchy.
This layered coding means that dropping the top layer degrades the user experience in a configured way.
Examples include reducing the resolution, picture quality, and/or frame rate.</t>

<t>Here is an example SVC encoding with 3 resolutions:</t>

</section>
<section anchor="frames" title="Frames">
<t>With full knowledge of the encoding, the encoder MAY can split a GoP into multiple segments based on the frame.
However, this is highly dependent on the encoding, and the additional complexity might not improve the user experience.</t>

<t>For example, we could split our example B-frame structure (<xref target="appendix.b-frame"/>) into 13 segments:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      2     4           7     9           12

|  I  |  P  |  P  |  I  |  P  |  P  |  I  |  P  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   1     3     5     6     8     10    11    13
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>To reduce the number of segments, segments can be merged with their dependency.
QUIC streams will deliver each segment in order so this produces the same result as reordering within the application.</t>

<t>The same GoP structure can be represented using eight segments:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      2     3           5     6           8
+--------+--------+-----------------+------------
|     B  |  B     |     B  |  B     |     B     |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
|  I     P     P  |  I     P     P  |  I     P
+-----------------+-----------------+------------
         1                 4              7
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>We can further reduce the number of segments by combining frames that don't depend on each other.
The only restriction is that frames can only reference frames earlier in the segment, or within a dependency segment.
For example, non-reference frames can have their own segment so they can be prioritized or dropped separate from reference frames.</t>

<t>The same GoP structure can also be represented using six segments, although we've removed the ability to drop individual B-frames:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   segment 2     segment 4   segment 6
+-------------+-------------+---------
|    B   B    |    B   B    |    B

<t>Initialization data (<xref target="appendix.init"/>) is required to initialize the decoder.
Each segment MAY start with initialization data although this adds overhead.</t>

<t>Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to create a init segment.
Each media segment can then depend on the init segment to avoid the redundant overhead.
For example:</t>

<section anchor="audio" title="Audio">
<t>Audio (<xref target="appendix.audio"/>) is much simpler than video so there's fewer options.</t>

<t>The simplest configuration is to use a single segment for each audio track.
This may seem inefficient given the ease of dropping audio samples.
However, the audio bitrate is low and gaps cause quite a poor user experience, when compared to video.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
         segment 1
+---------------------------
| S S S S S S S S S S S S S
+---------------------------
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>An improvement is to periodically split audio samples into separate segments.
This gives the consumer the ability to skip ahead during severe congestion or temporary connectivity loss.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    segment 1       segment 2    segment 3
+---------------+---------------+---------
| S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S
+---------------+---------------+---------
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This frequency of audio segments is configurable, at the cost of additional overhead.
It's NOT RECOMMENDED to create a segment for each audio frame because of this overhead.</t>

<t>Since video can only recover from severe congestion with an I-frame, so there's not much point recovering audio at a separate interval.
It is RECOMMENDED to create a new audio segment at each video I-frame.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    segment 1       segment 3    segment 5

<section anchor="appendix.delivery-order" title="Delivery Order">

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   (&quot;Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time&quot;) uses recent
   measurements of a transport connection&#39;s delivery rate, round-trip
   time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network
   path.  BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends
   data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the
   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control
   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC8312], BBR offers
   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers
   or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for
   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding &quot;bufferbloat&quot;).  BBR can be
   implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery
   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are available
   for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies version
   2 of the BBR algorithm, also sometimes referred to as BBRv2 or bbr2.
