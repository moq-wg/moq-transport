--- abstract

This document defines the core behavior for Warp, a live media transport protocol over QUIC.
Media is split into objects based on the underlying media encoding and transmitted independently over QUIC streams.
QUIC streams are prioritized based on the delivery order, allowing less important objects to be starved or dropped during congestion.

# Model

The basic element of Warp is *a media object*. A media object is a single addressable cacheable unit that may either contain a sequence of media samples, or some media-specific metadata, and may have relay-related attributes such as TTL or delivery priority associated with it. A media object is a sequence of bytes with a finite length. A Warp media object is similar in function to what is often referred to as "segments" or "chunks" in other media protocols; however, they are different from the traditional notion of chunks. The first key distinction is that Warp media objects are not always expected to be fully available, and thus any relays have to be able to convey partial media objects. The second key distinction is that Warp media objects may not be fully decodable by themselves; an object will contain a description of the prerequisites if that is the case.

*A media track* in Warp is a combination of *an init object* and a sequence of media objects. An init object is a format-specific self-contained description of the track that is required to decode any media object contained within the track, but can also be used as the metadata for track selection. If two media tracks carry semantically equivalent but differently encoded media, they are referred to as *variants* of each other.

*A Warp broadcast* is a collection of multiple media tracks produced by a single origin. When subscribing to a broadcast, a peer has an option of subscribing to one, many or all media tracks within the broadcast.

A Warp broadcast is globally identifiable via a URI. Within the broadcast, every media track is identified via *a track ID* that is unique within the broadcast. Within a single media track, every media object is identified by an *object ID* that is unique within the track.

Depending on the profile of the application using it, Warp supports both a mode of operation where the peer unilaterally sends a broadcast with the media tracks of its choice, and a mode where the peer has to explicitly subscribe to a broadcast and select media tracks it wishes to receive.

As an example, consider a scenario where `example.org` hosts a simple live stream that anyone can subscribe to. That live stream would be a single Warp broadcast identified by the URL `https://example.org/livestream`. In the simplest implementation, it would provide only two media tracks, one with audio and one with video. In more complicated scenarios, it could provide multiple video formats of different levels of video quality; those tracks would be variants of each other. Note that the track IDs are opaque on the Warp level; if the player has not received the description of media tracks out of band in advance, it would have to request the broadcast description first.


# Motivation

## Latency
In a perfect world, we could deliver live media at the same rate it is produced.
The end-to-end latency of a broadcast would be fixed and only subject to encoding and transmission delays.
Unfortunately, networks have variable throughput, primarily due to congestion.

Attempting to deliver media encoded at a higher bitrate than the network can support causes queuing.
This queuing can occur anywhere in the path between the encoder and decoder.
For example: the application, the OS socket, a wifi router, within an ISP, or generally anywhere in transit.

If nothing is done, new frames will be appended to the end of a growing queue and will take longer to arrive than their predecessors, increasing latency.
Our job is to minimize the growth of this queue, and if necessary, bypass the queue entirely by dropping content.

The speed at which a media protocol can detect and respond to queuing determines the latency.
We can generally classify existing media protocols into two categories based on the underlying network protocol:

* TCP-based media protocols (ex. RTMP, HLS, DASH) are popular due to their simplicity.
Media is served/consumed in decode order while any networking is handled by the TCP layer.
However, these protocols primarily see usage at higher latency targets due to their relatively slow detection and response to queuing.

* UDP-based media protocols (ex. RTP, WebRTC, SRT) can side-step the issues with TCP and provide lower latency with better queue management.
However the media protocol is now responsible for fragmentation, congestion control, retransmissions, receiver feedback, reassembly, and more.
This added complexity significantly raises the implementation difficulty and hurts interoperability.

A goal of this draft is to get the best of both worlds: a simple protocol that can still rapidly detect and respond to congestion.
This is possible with the emergence of QUIC, designed to fix the shortcomings of TCP.

## Universal
The media protocol ecosystem is fragmented; each protocol has it's own niche.
Specialization is often a good thing, but we believe there's enough overlap to warrant consolidation.

For example, a service might simultaneously ingest via WebRTC, SRT, RTMP, and/or a custom UDP protocol depending on the broadcaster.
The same service might then simultaneously distribute via WebRTC, LL-HLS, HLS, (or the DASH variants) and/or a custom UDP protocol depending on the viewer.

These media protocols are often radically different and not interoperable; requiring transcoding or transmuxing.
This cost is further increased by the need to maintain separate stacks with different expertise requirements.

A goal of this draft is to cover a large spectrum of use-cases. Specifically:

* Consolidated contribution and distribution.
The primary difference between the two is the ability to fanout.
How does a CDN know how to forward media to N consumers and how does it reduce the encoded bitrate during congestion?
A single protocol can cover both use-cases provided relays are informed on how to forward and drop media.

* A configurable latency versus quality trade-off.
The producer (broadcaster) chooses how to encode and transmit media based on the desired user experience.
Each consumer (viewer) chooses how long to wait for media based on their desired user experience and network.
We want an experience that can vary from real-time and lossy for one viewer, to delayed and loss-less for another viewer, without separate encodings or protocols.

A related goal is to not reinvent how media is encoded.
The same codec bitstream and container should be usable between different protocols.

## Relays
The prevailing belief is that UDP-based protocols are more expensive and don't "scale".
While it's true that UDP is more difficult to optimize than TCP, QUIC itself is proof that it is possible to reach performance parity.
In fact even some TCP-based protocols (ex. RTMP) don't "scale" either and are exclusively used for contribution as a result.

The ability to scale a media protocol actually depends on relay support: proxies, caches, CDNs, SFUs, etc.
The success of HTTP-based media protocols is due to the ability to leverage traditional HTTP CDNs.

It's difficult to build a CDN for media protocols that were not designed with relays in mind.
For example, an relay has to parse the underlying codec to determine which RTP packets should be dropped first, and the decision is not deterministic or consistent for each hop.
This is the fatal flaw of many UDP-based protocols.

A goal of this draft is to treat relays as first class citizens.
Any identification, reliability, ordering, prioritization, caching, etc is written to the wire in a header that is easy to parse.
This ensures that relays can easily route/fanout media to the final destination.
This also ensures that congestion response is consistent at every hop based on the preferences of the media producer.


# Objects
Warp works by splitting media into objects that can be transferred over QUIC streams.

* The encoder determines how to fragment the encoded bitstream into objects ({{media}}).
* Objects are assigned an intended delivery order that should be obeyed during congestion ({{delivery-order}})
* The decoder receives each objects and skips any objects that do not arrive in time ({{decoder}}).

## Media
An encoder produces one or more codec bitstreams for each track.
The decoder processes the codec bitstreams in the same order they were produced, with some possible exceptions based on the encoding.
See the appendix for an overview of media encoding ({{appendix.encoding}}).

Warp works by fragmenting the bitstream into objects that can be transmitted somewhat independently.
Depending on how the objects are fragmented, the decoder has the ability to safely drop media during congestion.
See the appendix for fragmentation examples ({{appendix.examples}})

A media object:

* MUST contain a single track.
* MUST be in decode order. This means an increasing DTS.
* MAY contain any number of frames/samples.
* MAY have gaps between frames/samples.
* MAY overlap with other objects. This means timestamps may be interleaved between objects.

Media objects are encoded using a specified container ({{containers}}).

## Delivery Order
Media is produced with an intended order, both in terms of when media should be presented (PTS) and when media should be decoded (DTS).
As stated in motivation ({{latency}}), the network is unable to maintain this ordering during congestion without increasing latency.

The encoder determines how to behave during congestion by assigning each object a numeric delivery order.
The delivery order SHOULD be followed when possible to ensure that the most important media is delivered when throughput is limited.
Note that the contents within each object are still delivered in order; this delivery order only applies to the ordering between objects.

A sender MUST send each object over a dedicated QUIC stream.
The QUIC library should support prioritization ({{prioritization}}) such that streams are transmitted in delivery order.

A receiver MUST NOT assume that objects will be received in delivery order for a number of reasons:

* Newly encoded objects MAY have a smaller delivery order than outstanding objects.
* Packet loss or flow control MAY delay the delivery of individual streams.
* The sender might not support QUIC stream prioritization.


## Decoder
The decoder will receive multiple objects in parallel and out of order.

Objects arrive in delivery order, but media usually needs to be processed in decode order.
The decoder SHOULD use a buffer to reassmble objects into decode order and it SHOULD skip objects after a configurable duration.
The amount of time the decoder is willing to wait for an object (buffer duration) is what ultimately determines the end-to-end latency.

Objects MUST synchronize frames within and between tracks using presentation timestamps within the container.
Objects are NOT REQUIRED to be aligned and the decoder MUST be prepared to skip over any gaps.


# QUIC

## Establishment
A connection is established using WebTransport {{WebTransport}}.

To summarize:
The client issues a HTTP CONNECT request with the intention of establishing a new WebTransport session.
The server returns an 200 OK response if the WebTransport session has been established, or an error status otherwise.

A WebTransport session exposes the basic QUIC service abstractions.
Specifically, either endpoint may create independent streams which are reliably delivered in order until canceled.

WebTransport can currently operate via HTTP/3 and HTTP/2, using QUIC or TCP under the hood respectively.
As mentioned in the motivation ({{motivation}}) section, TCP introduces head-of-line blocking and will result in a worse experience.
It is RECOMMENDED to use WebTransport over HTTP/3.

The application SHOULD use the CONNECT request for authentication.
For example, including a authentication token and some identifier in the path.

## Streams
Warp endpoints communicate over QUIC streams. Every stream is a sequence of messages, framed as described in {{messages}}.

The first stream opened is a client-initiated bidirectional stream where the peers exchange SETUP messages ({{setup}}). The subsequent streams MAY be either unidirectional and bidirectional. For exchanging media, an application would typically send a unidirectional stream containing a single OBJECT message ({{object}}).

Messages SHOULD be sent over the same stream if ordering is desired.
For example, `PAUSE` and `PLAY` messages SHOULD be sent on the same stream to avoid a race.

## Prioritization
Warp utilizes stream prioritization to deliver the most important content during congestion.

The encoder may assign a numeric delivery order to each stream ({{delivery-order}})
This is a strict prioritization scheme, such that any available bandwidth is allocated to streams in ascending priority order.
The sender SHOULD prioritize streams based on the delivery order.
If two streams have the same delivery order, they SHOULD receive equal bandwidth (round-robin).

QUIC supports stream prioritization but does not standardize any mechanisms; see Section 2.3 in {{QUIC}}.
In order to support prioritization, a QUIC library MUST expose a API to set the priority of each stream.
This is relatively easy to implement; the next QUIC packet should contain a STREAM frame for the next pending stream in priority order.

The sender MUST respect flow control even if means delivering streams out of delivery order.
It is OPTIONAL to prioritize retransmissions.

## Cancellation
A QUIC stream MAY be canceled at any point with an error code.
The producer does this via a `RESET_STREAM` frame while the consumer requests cancellation with a `STOP_SENDING` frame.

When using `order`, lower priority streams will be starved during congestion, perhaps indefinitely.
These streams will consume resources and flow control until they are canceled.
When nearing resource limits, an endpoint SHOULD cancel the lowest priority stream with error code 0.

The sender MAY cancel streams in response to congestion.
This can be useful when the sender does not support stream prioritization.

## Relays
Warp encodes the delivery information for a stream via OBJECT headers ({{object}}).

A relay SHOULD prioritize streams ({{prioritization}}) based on the delivery order.
A relay MAY change the delivery order, in which case it SHOULD update the value on the wire for future hops.

A relay that reads from a stream and writes to stream in order will introduce head-of-line blocking.
Packet loss will cause stream data to be buffered in the QUIC library, awaiting in order delivery, which will increase latency over additional hops.
To mitigate this, a relay SHOULD read and write QUIC stream data out of order subject to flow control limits.
See section 2.2 in {{QUIC}}.

## Congestion Control
As covered in the motivation section ({{motivation}}), the ability to prioritize or cancel streams is a form of congestion response.
It's equally important to detect congestion via congestion control, which is handled in the QUIC layer {{QUIC-RECOVERY}}.

Bufferbloat is caused by routers queueing packets for an indefinite amount of time rather than drop them.
This latency significantly reduces the ability for the application to prioritize or drop media in response to congestion.
Senders SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm that reduces this bufferbloat (ex. {{BBR}}).
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use a loss-based algorithm (ex. {{NewReno}}) unless the network fully supports ECN.

Live media is application-limited, which means that the encoder determines the max bitrate rather than the network.
Most TCP congestion control algorithms will only increase the congestion window if it is full, limiting the upwards mobility when application-limited.
Senders SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm that is designed for application-limited flows (ex. GCC).
Senders MAY periodically pad the connection with QUIC PING frames to fill the congestion window.

## Termination
The QUIC connection can be terminated at any point with an error code.

The media producer MAY terminate the QUIC connection with an error code of 0 to indicate the clean termination of the broadcast.
The application SHOULD use a non-zero error code to indicate a fatal error.

# Tracks

A Warp broadcast consists of one or more tracks. Each track has a *track format* associated with it; a track format defines how to interpret the track bitstream and the metadata associated with the track. This document defines a single format for a track based on [ISOBMFF]; additional documents may define new formats.

Every Warp track has a *track descriptor* associated with it. A track descriptor contains information required to decode the track. The descriptor has the following format:

~~~
Track Descriptor {
  Track ID (i),
  Track Format (i),
  Format-Specific Metadata (...),
}
~~~
{: #warp-track-descriptor title="Warp Track Descriptor"}

Here, Track ID is the unique ID that identifies the track within the broadcast. Track Format idetifies the format used by the track; for the ISOBMFF-based format described in this document, 0x00 is specified. In the case 0x00 is used, Format-Specific Metadata contains a `ftyp` box followed by a `moov` box.

A track descriptor may appear in both the SETUP message and a subsequent TRACK message.


# Messages
Both unidirectional and bidirectional Warp streams are sequences of length-deliminated messages.

~~~
Warp Message {
  Message Type (i),
  Message Length (i),
  Message Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #warp-message-format title="Warp Message"}

The Message Length field contains the length of the Message Payload field in bytes.

|------|-----------------------|
| ID   | Messages              |
|-----:|:----------------------|
| 0x0  | OBJECT ({{object}})   |
|------|-----------------------|
| 0x1  | SETUP ({{setup}})     |
|------|-----------------------|
| 0x10 | GOAWAY ({{goaway}})   |
|------|-----------------------|

## SETUP

The `SETUP` message is the first message that is exchanged by the client and the server; it allows the peers to establish the mutually supported version and agree on the initial configuration. It is a sequence of key-value pairs called *SETUP parameters*; the semantics and the format of individual parameter values MAY depend on what party is sending it.

The wire format of the SETUP message is as follows:

~~~
SETUP Parameter {
  Parameter Key (i),
  Parameter Value Length (i),
  Parameter Value (..),
}

Client SETUP Message Payload {
  Number of Supported Versions (i),
  Supported Version (i) ...,
  SETUP Parameters (..) ...,
}

Server SETUP Message Payload {
  Selected Version (i),
  SETUP Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #warp-setup-format title="Warp SETUP Message"}

The Parameter Value Length field indicates the length of the Parameter Value.

The client offers the list of the protocol versions it supports; the server MUST reply with one of the versions offered by the client. If the server does not support any of the versions offered by the client, or the client receives a server version that it did not offer, the corresponding peer MUST close the connection.

The SETUP parameters are described in the {{setup-parameters}} section.

## OBJECT
A OBJECT message contains a single media object associated with a specified track, as well as associated metadata required to deliver, cache, and forward it.

The format of the OBJECT message is as follows:

~~~
OBJECT Header {
  Header Name Length (8),
  Header Name (..),
  Header Value Length (i),
  Header Value (..),
}

OBJECT Message {
  Track ID (i),
  Number of Object Headers (i),
  Object Headers (..) ...,
  Object Payload (..)
}
~~~
{: #warp-object-format title="Warp OBJECT Message"}

This document defines the following headers:

* `id`.
An unique identifier for the stream.
This field is optional and MUST be unique if set.

* `order`.
An integer indicating the delivery order ({{delivery-order}}).
This field is optional and the default value is 0.

The payload of the OBJECT message consists of a fragmented MP4 container ({{fmp4}}).

## GOAWAY
The `GOAWAY` message is sent by the server to force the client to reconnect.
This is useful for server maintenance or reassignments without severing the QUIC connection.
The server MAY be a producer or consumer.

The server:

* MAY initiate a graceful shutdown by sending a GOAWAY message.
* MUST close the QUIC connection after a timeout with the GOAWAY error code ({{termination}}).
* MAY close the QUIC connection with a different error code if there is a fatal error before shutdown.
* SHOULD wait until the `GOAWAY` message and any pending streams have been fully acknowledged, plus an extra delay to ensure they have been processed.

The client:

* MUST establish a new WebTransport session to the provided URL upon receipt of a `GOAWAY` message.
* SHOULD establish the connection in parallel which MUST use different QUIC connection.
* SHOULD remain connected for two servers for a short period, processing objects from both in parallel.

# SETUP Parameters

The SETUP message ({{setup}}) allows the peers to exchange arbitrary parameters before any media is exchanged. It is the main extensibility mechanism of Warp. The peers MUST ignore unknown parameters. TODO: describe GREASE for those.

Every parameter MUST appear at most once within the SETUP message. The peers SHOULD verify that and close the connection if a parameter appears more than once.

The ROLE parameter is mandatory for the client. All of the other parameters are optional.

## ROLE parameter

The ROLE parameter (key 0x00) allows the client to specify what roles it expects the parties to have in the Warp connection. It has three possible values:

0x01:

: Only the client is expected to send media on the connection. This is commonly referred to as *the ingestion case*.

0x02:

: Only the server is expected to send media on the connection. This is commonly referred to as *the delivery case*.

0x03:

: Both the client and the server are expected to send media.

The client MUST send a ROLE parameter with one of the three values specified above. The server MUST close the connection if the ROLE parameter is missing, is not one of the three above-specified values, or it is different from what the server expects based on the application in question.

# Containers
A media container contains the underlying codec bitstream.
It also contains metadata, such as timestamps, which is required to decode and display the media.

This draft currently specifies only a single media container.
Future drafts and extensions may specify additional containers.

## fMP4
The `video/mp4` and `audio/mp4` mimetype indicate a fragmented MP4 container {{ISOBMFF}}.

An initialization segment consists of a File Type Box (ftyp) followed by a Movie Box (moov).
This Movie Box (moov) consists of Movie Header Boxes (mvhd), Track Header Boxes (tkhd), Track Boxes (trak), followed by a final Movie Extends Box (mvex).
These boxes MUST NOT contain any samples and MUST have a duration of zero.
A Common Media Application Format Header {{CMAF}} meets all these requirements.

A media segment consists of have a Segment Type Box (styp) followed by any number of media fragments.
Each media fragment consists of a Movie Fragment Box (moof) followed by a Media Data Box (mdat).
The Media Fragment Box (moof) MUST contain a Movie Fragment Header Box (mfhd) and Track Box (trak) with a Track ID (`track_ID`) matching a Track Box in the initialization fragment.
A Common Media Application Format Segment {{CMAF}} meets all these requirements.

Media fragments can be packaged at any frequency, causing a trade-off between overhead and latency.
It is RECOMMENDED that a media fragment consists of a single frame to minimize latency.

# Security Considerations

## Resource Exhaustion
Live media requires significant bandwidth and resources.
Failure to set limits will quickly cause resource exhaustion.

Warp uses QUIC flow control to impose resource limits at the network layer.
Endpoints SHOULD set flow control limits based on the anticipated media bitrate.

The media producer prioritizes and transmits streams out of order.
Streams might be starved indefinitely during congestion.
The producer and consumer MUST cancel a stream, preferably the lowest priority, after reaching a resource limit.

# IANA Considerations

TODO: fill out currently missing registries:
* Warp version numbers
* SETUP parameters
* Track format numbers
* Message types
* Object headers

# Appendix A. Video Encoding {#appendix.encoding}
In order to transport media, we first need to know how media is encoded.
This section is an overview of media encoding.

## Tracks
A broadcast consists of one or more tracks.
Each track has a type (audio, video, caption, etc) and uses a corresponding codec.
There may be multiple tracks, including of the same type for a number of reasons.

For example:

* A track for each codec.
* A track for each resolution and bitrate.
* A track for each language.
* A track for each camera feed.

Tracks can be muxed together into a single container or stream.
The goal of Warp is to independently deliver tracks, and even parts of a track, so this is not allowed.
Each Warp object MUST contain a single track.

## Init {#appendix.init}
Media codecs have a wide array of configuration options.
For example, the resolution, the color space, the features enabled, etc.

Before playback can begin, the decoder needs to know the configuration.
This is done via a short payload at the very start of the media file.
The initialization payload MAY be cached and reused between objects with the same configuration.

## Video {#appendix.video}
Video is a sequence of pictures (frames) with a presentation timestamp (PTS).

An I-frame is a frame with no dependencies and is effectively an image file.
These frames are usually inserted at a frequent interval to support seeking or joining a live stream.
However they can also improve compression when used at scene boundaries.

A P-frame is a frame that references on one or more earlier frames.
These frames are delta-encoded, such that they only encode the changes (motion).
This result in a massive file size reduction for most content outside of few notorious cases (ex. confetti).

A common encoding structure is to only reference the previous frame, as it is simple and minimizes latency:

~~~
 I <- P <- P <- P   I <- P <- P <- P   I <- P ...
~~~

There is no such thing as an optimal encoding structure.
Encoders tuned for the best quality will produce a tangled spaghetti of references.
Encoders tuned for the lowest latency can avoid reference frames to allow more to be dropped.

### B-Frames {#appendix.b-frame}
The goal of video codecs is to maximize compression.
One of the improvements is to allow a frame to reference later frames.

A B-frame is a frame that can reference one or more frames in the future, and any number of frames in the past.
These frames are more difficult to encode/decode as they require buffering and reordering.

A common encoding structure is to use B-frames in a fixed pattern.
Such a fixed pattern is not optimal, but it's simpler for hardware encoding:

~~~
    B     B         B     B         B
   / \   / \       / \   / \       / \
  v   v v   v     v   v v   v     v   v
 I <-- P <-- P   I <-- P <-- P   I <-- P ...
~~~

### Timestamps
Each frame is assigned a presentation timestamp (PTS), indicating when it should be shown relative to other frames.

The encoder outputs the bitstream in decode order, which means that each frame is output after its references.
This makes it easier for the decoder as all references are earlier in the bitstream and can be decoded immediately.

However, this causes problems with B-frames because they depend on a future frame, and some reordering has to occur.
In order to keep track of this, frames have a decode timestamp (DTS) in addition to a presentation timestamp (PTS).
A B-frame will have higher DTS value that its dependencies, while PTS and DTS will be the same for other frame types.

For the example above, this would look like:

~~~
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
PTS: I B P B P I B P B P B
DTS: I   PB  PBI   PB  PB
~~~

B-frames add latency because of this reordering so they are usually not used for conversational latency.

### Group of Pictures {#appendix.gop}
A group of pictures (GoP) is an I-frame followed by any number of frames until the next I-frame.
All frames MUST reference, either directly or indirectly, only the most recent I-frame.

~~~
        GoP               GoP            GoP
+-----------------+-----------------+---------------
|     B     B     |     B     B     |     B
|    / \   / \    |    / \   / \    |    / \
|   v   v v   v   |   v   v v   v   |   v   v
|  I <-- P <-- P  |  I <-- P <-- P  |  I <-- P ...
+-----------------+-----------------+--------------
~~~

This is a useful abstraction because GoPs can always be decoded independently.

### Scalable Video Coding {#appendix.svc}
Some codecs support scalable video coding (SVC), in which the encoder produces multiple bitstreams in a hierarchy.
This layered coding means that dropping the top layer degrades the user experience in a configured way.
Examples include reducing the resolution, picture quality, and/or frame rate.

Here is an example SVC encoding with 3 resolutions:

~~~

## Audio {#appendix.audio}
Audio is dramatically simpler than video as it is not typically delta encoded.
Audio samples are grouped together (group of samples) at a configured rate, also called a "frame".

The encoder spits out a continuous stream of samples (S):

~~~
S S S S S S S S S S S S S ...
~~~


# Appendix B. Object Examples {#appendix.examples}
Warp offers a large degree of flexibility on how objects are fragmented and prioritized.
There is no best solution; it depends on the desired complexity and user experience.

This section provides a summary of some options available.

## Video

### Group of Pictures
A group of pictures (GoP) is consists of an I-frame and all frames that directly or indirectly reference it ({{appendix.gop}}).
The tail of a GoP can be dropped without causing decode errors, even if the encoding is otherwise unknown, making this the safest option.

It is RECOMMENDED that each object consist of a single GoP.
For example:

~~~
     object 1        object 2     object 3
+---------------+---------------+---------
| I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B
+---------------+---------------+---------
~~~

Depending on the video encoding, this approach may introduce unnecessary ordering and dependencies.
A better option may be available below.

### Scalable Video Coding
Some codecs support scalable video coding (SVC), in which the encoder produces multiple bitstreams in a hierarchy ({{appendix.svc}}).

When SVC is used, it is RECOMMENDED that each object consist of a single layer and GoP.
For example:

~~~
                object 3              object 6
      +-------------------------+---------------
   4k |  P <- P <- P <- P <- P  |  P <- P <- P
      |  |    |    |    |    |  |  |    |    |
      |  v    v    v    v    v  |  v    v    v
      +-------------------------+--------------

                object 2              object 5
      +-------------------------+---------------
1080p |  P <- P <- P <- P <- P  |  P <- P <- P
      |  |    |    |    |    |  |  |    |    |
      |  v    v    v    v    v  |  v    v    v
      +-------------------------+--------------

                object 1              object 4
      +-------------------------+---------------
 360p |  I <- P <- P <- P <- P  |  I <- P <- P
      +-------------------------+---------------
~~~


### Frames
With full knowledge of the encoding, the encoder MAY can split a GoP into multiple objects based on the frame.
However, this is highly dependent on the encoding, and the additional complexity might not improve the user experience.

For example, we could split our example B-frame structure ({{appendix.b-frame}}) into 13 objects:

~~~
      2     4           7     9           12
+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
|     B  |  B     |     B  |  B     |     B     |
|-----+--+--+-----+-----+--+--+-----+-----+-----+
|  I  |  P  |  P  |  I  |  P  |  P  |  I  |  P  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   1     3     5     6     8     10    11    13
~~~

Objects can be merged with their dependency to reduce the total number of objects.
QUIC streams will deliver each object in order so the QUIC library performs the reordering.

The same GoP structure can be represented using eight objects:

~~~
      2     3           5     6           8
+--------+--------+-----------------+------------
|     B  |  B     |     B  |  B     |     B     |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----------+
|  I     P     P  |  I     P     P  |  I     P
+-----------------+-----------------+------------
         1                 4              7
~~~

We can further reduce the number of objects by combining frames that don't depend on each other.
The only restriction is that frames can only reference frames earlier in the object.
For example, non-reference frames can have their own object so they can be prioritized or dropped separate from reference frames.

The same GoP structure can also be represented using six objects, although we've removed the ability to drop individual B-frames:

~~~
    object 2      object 4    object 6
+-------------+-------------+---------
|    B   B    |    B   B    |    B
+-------------+-------------+---------
|  I   P   P  |  I   P   P  |  I   P
+-------------+-------------+---------
    object 1      object 3    object 5
~~~

### Init
Initialization data ({{appendix.init}}) is required to initialize the decoder.
Each object MAY start with initialization data although this adds overhead.

Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to create a init object.
Each media object can then depend on the init object to avoid the redundant overhead.
For example:

~~~
     object 2        object 3     object 5
+---------------+---------------+---------
| I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B
+---------------+---------------+---------
|              init             |  init
+-------------------------------+---------
              object 1            object 4
~~~


## Audio
Audio ({{appendix.audio}}) is much simpler than video so there's fewer options.

The simplest configuration is to use a single object for each audio track.
This may seem inefficient given the ease of dropping audio samples.
However, the audio bitrate is low and gaps cause quite a poor user experience, when compared to video.

~~~
          object 1
+---------------------------
| S S S S S S S S S S S S S
+---------------------------
~~~

An improvement is to periodically split audio samples into separate objects.
This gives the consumer the ability to skip ahead during severe congestion or temporary connectivity loss.

~~~
     object 1        object 2     object 3
+---------------+---------------+---------
| S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S
+---------------+---------------+---------
~~~

This frequency of audio objects is configurable, at the cost of additional overhead.
It's NOT RECOMMENDED to create a object for each audio frame because of this overhead.

Since video can only recover from severe congestion with an I-frame, so there's not much point recovering audio at a separate interval.
It is RECOMMENDED to create a new audio object at each video I-frame.

~~~
     object 1        object 3     object 5
+---------------+---------------+---------
| S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S  S  S | S  S  S
+---------------+---------------+---------
| I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B  P  B | I  P  B
+---------------+---------------+---------
     object 2        object 4     object 6
~~~

## Delivery Order {#appendix.delivery-order}
The delivery order ({{delivery-order}} depends on the desired user experience during congestion:

* if media should be skipped: delivery order = PTS
* if media should not be skipped: delivery order = -PTS
* if video should be skipped before audio: audio delivery order < video delivery order

The delivery order may be changed if the content changes.
For example, switching from a live stream (skippable) to an advertisement (unskippable).
