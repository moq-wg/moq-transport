--- abstract

This document defines the core behavior for Media over QUIC Transport
(MOQT), a media transport protocol designed to operate over QUIC and
WebTransport, which have similar functionality. MOQT allows a producer of
media to publish data and have it consumed via subscription by a
multiplicity of endpoints. It supports intermediate content distribution
networks and is designed for high scale and low latency distribution.

# Introduction

Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) is a protocol that is optimized
for the QUIC protocol {{QUIC}}, either directly or via WebTransport
{{WebTransport}}, for the dissemination of media. MOQT utilizes a
publish/subscribe workflow in which producers of media publish data in
response to subscription requests from a multiplicity of endpoints. MOQT
supports wide range of use-cases with different resiliency and latency
(live, interactive) needs without compromising the scalability and cost
effectiveness associated with content delivery networks.

MOQT is a generic protocol designed to work in concert with multiple
MoQ Streaming Formats. These MoQ Streaming Formats define how content is
encoded, packaged, and mapped to MOQT objects, along with policies for
discovery and subscription.

* {{model}} describes the data model employed by MOQT.

* {{session}} covers aspects of setting up an MOQT session.

* {{priorities}} covers mechanisms for prioritizing subscriptions.

* {{relays-moq}} covers behavior at the relay entities.

* {{message}} covers how control messages are encoded on the wire.

* {{data-streams}} covers how data messages are encoded on the wire.


## Motivation

The development of MOQT is driven by goals in a number of areas -
specifically latency, the robust feature set of QUIC and relay
support.

### Latency

Latency is necessary to correct for variable network throughput. Ideally live
content is consumed at the same bitrate it is produced. End-to-end latency would
be fixed and only subject to encoding and transmission delays. Unfortunately,
networks have variable throughput, primarily due to congestion. Attempting to
deliver content encoded at a higher bitrate than the network can cause
queuing along the path from producer to consumer. The speed at which a protocol
can detect and respond to congestion determines the overall latency. TCP-based
protocols are simple but are slow to detect congestion and suffer from
head-of-line blocking. Protocols utilizing UDP directly can avoid queuing, but
the application is then responsible for the complexity of fragmentation,
congestion control, retransmissions, receiver feedback, reassembly, and
more. One goal of MOQT is to achieve the best of both these worlds: leverage the
features of QUIC to create a simple yet flexible low latency protocol that can
rapidly detect and respond to congestion.

### Leveraging QUIC

The parallel nature of QUIC streams can provide improvements in the face
of loss. A goal of MOQT is to design a streaming protocol to leverage
the transmission benefits afforded by parallel QUIC streams as well
exercising options for flexible loss recovery.

### Convergence

Some live media architectures today have separate protocols for ingest and
distribution, for example RTMP and HTTP based HLS or DASH. Switching protocols
necessitates intermediary origins which re-package the
media content. While specialization can have its benefits, there are efficiency
gains to be had in not having to re-package content. A goal of MOQT is to
develop a single protocol which can be used for transmission from contribution
to distribution. A related goal is the ability to support existing encoding and
packaging schemas, both for backwards compatibility and for interoperability
with the established content preparation ecosystem.

### Relays

An integral feature of a protocol being successful is its ability to
deliver media at scale. Greatest scale is achieved when third-party
networks, independent of both the publisher and subscriber, can be
leveraged to relay the content. These relays must cache content for
distribution efficiency while simultaneously routing content and
deterministically responding to congestion in a multi-tenant network. A
goal of MOQT is to treat relays as first-class citizens of the protocol
and ensure that objects are structured such that information necessary
for distribution is available to relays while the media content itself
remains opaque and private.

: An endpoint that subscribes to and receives tracks.

Original Publisher:

: The initial publisher of a given track.

End Subscriber:

: A subscriber that initiates a subscription and does not send the data on to other subscribers.

Relay:

: An entity that is both a Publisher and a Subscriber, is not the Original
Publisher or End Subscriber, and conforms to all requirements in {{relays-moq}}.

  bytes. Objects form the base element in the MOQT data model. See
  ({{model-object}}).

Track:

: A track is a collection of groups. See ({{model-track}}).

## Stream Management Terms

This document uses stream management terms described in {{?RFC9000, Section
1.3}} including STOP_SENDING, RESET_STREAM and FIN.

## Notational Conventions

This document uses the conventions detailed in ({{?RFC9000, Section 1.3}})
when describing the binary encoding.

As a quick reference, the following list provides a non normative summary
of the parts of RFC9000 field syntax that are used in this specification.

x (L):

: Indicates that x is L bits long.

x (i):

: Indicates that x holds an integer value using the variable-length
  encoding as described in ({{?RFC9000, Section 16}}).

x (..):

: Indicates that x can be any length including zero bits long.  Values
 in this format always end on a byte boundary.

[x (L)]:

: Indicates that x is optional and has a length of L.

x (L) ...:

: Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times and that each instance
  has a length of L.

To reduce unnecessary use of bandwidth, variable length integers SHOULD
be encoded using the least number of bytes possible to represent the
required value.

### Location Structure

Location identifies a particular Object in a Group within a Track.

~~~
Location {
  Group (i),
  Object (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-location format title="Location structure"}

In this document, the constituent parts of any Location A can be referred to
using A.Group or A.Object.

Location A < Location B if:

`A.Group < B.Group || (A.Group == B.Group && A.Object < B.Object)`

### Key-Value-Pair Structure

Key-Value-Pair is a flexible structure designed to carry key/value
pairs in which the key is a variable length integer and the value
is either a variable length integer or a byte field of arbitrary
length.

Key-Value-Pair is used in both the data plane and control plane, but
is optimized for use in the data plane.

~~~
Key-Value-Pair {
  Type (i),
  [Length (i),]
  Value (..)
}
~~~
{: #moq-key-value-pair format title="MOQT Key-Value-Pair"}

* Type: an unsigned integer, encoded as a varint, identifying the
  type of the value and also the subsequent serialization.
* Length: Only present when Type is odd. Specifies the length of the Value field
  in bytes. The maximum length of a value is 2^16-1 bytes.  If an endpoint
  receives a length larger than the maximum, it MUST close the session with a
  Protocol Violation.
* Value: A single varint encoded value when Type is even, otherwise a
  sequence of Length bytes.

If a receiver understands a Type, and the following Value or Length/Value does
not match the serialization defined by that Type, the receiver MUST terminate
the session with error code `KEY_VALUE_FORMATTING_ERROR`.

### Reason Phrase Structure {#reason-phrase}

Reason Phrase provides a way for the sender to encode additional diagnostic
information about the error condition, where appropriate.

~~~
Reason Phrase {
  Reason Phrase Length (i),
  Reason Phrase Value (..)
}
~~~

* Reason Phrase Length: A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
  reason phrase in bytes. The reason phrase length has a maximum value of
  1024 bytes. If an endpoint receives a length exceeding the maximum, it MUST
  close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`

* Reason Phrase Value: Additional diagnostic information about the error condition.
  The reason phrase value is encoded as UTF-8 string and does not carry information,
  such as language tags, that would aid comprehension by any entity other than
  the one that created the text.

# Object Data Model {#model}

MOQT has a hierarchical data model, comprised of tracks which contain
groups, and groups that contain objects. Inside of a group, the objects
can be organized into subgroups.

To give an example of how an application might use this data model,
consider an application sending high and low resolution video using a
codec with temporal scalability. Each resolution is sent as a separate
track to allow the subscriber to pick the appropriate resolution given
the display environment and available bandwidth. Each independently
coded sequence of pictures in a resolution is sent as a group as the
first picture in the sequence can be used as a random access point.
This allows the client to join at the logical points where decoding
of the media can start without needing information before the join
points. The temporal layers are sent as separate subgroups to allow
the priority mechanism to favor lower temporal layers when there is
not enough bandwidth to send all temporal layers. Each frame of video
is sent as a single object.

## Objects {#model-object}

The basic data element of MOQT is an object.  An object is an
addressable unit whose payload is a sequence of bytes.  All objects
belong to a group, indicating ordering and potential
dependencies (see {{model-group}}).  An object is uniquely identified by
its track namespace, track name, group ID, and object ID, and must be an
identical sequence of bytes regardless of how or where it is retrieved.
An Object can become unavailable, but its contents MUST NOT change over
time.

Objects are comprised of two parts: metadata and a payload.  The metadata is
never encrypted and is always visible to relays (see {{relays-moq}}). The
payload portion may be encrypted, in which case it is only visible to the
Original Publisher and End Subscribers. The Original Publisher is solely
responsible for the content of the object payload. This includes the
underlying encoding, compression, any end-to-end encryption, or
authentication. A relay MUST NOT combine, split, or otherwise modify object
payloads.

Objects within a Group are ordered numerically by their Object ID.

## Subgroups {#model-subgroup}

A subgroup is a sequence of one or more objects from the same group
({{model-group}}) in ascending order by Object ID. Objects in a subgroup
have a dependency and priority relationship consistent with sharing a
stream and are sent on a single stream whenever possible. A Group is delivered
using at least as many streams as there are Subgroups,
typically with a one-to-one mapping between Subgroups and streams.

When a Track's forwarding preference (see {{object-properties}}) is
"Datagram", Objects are not sent in Subgroups and the
description in the remainder of this section does not apply.

Streams offer in-order reliable delivery and the ability to cancel sending and
retransmission of data. Furthermore, many QUIC and WebTransport implementations
offer the ability to control the relative priority of streams, which allows
control over the scheduling of sending data on active streams.

Every object within a Group belongs to exactly one Subgroup.

When Objects are sent in a subscription (see {{subscriptions}}),  Objects
from two subgroups cannot be sent on the same stream, and Objects from the
same Subgroup MUST NOT be sent on different streams, unless one of the streams
was reset prematurely, or upstream conditions have forced objects from a Subgroup
to be sent out of Object ID order.

Original publishers assign each Subgroup a Subgroup ID, and do so as they see fit.  The
scope of a Subgroup ID is a Group, so Subgroups from different Groups MAY share a Subgroup
ID without implying any relationship between them. In general, publishers assign
objects to subgroups in order to leverage the features of streams as described
above.

In general, if Object B is dependent on Object A, then delivery of B can follow
A, i.e. A and B can be usefully delivered over a single stream.  If an Object is
dependent on all previous Objects in a Subgroup, it likely fits best in that
Subgroup.  If an Object is not dependent on any of the Objects in a Subgroup, it
likely belongs in a different Subgroup.

When assigning Objects to different Subgroups, the Original Publisher makes a
reasonable tradeoff between having an optimal mapping of Object relationships in
a Group and minimizing the number of streams used.

## Groups {#model-group}

A group is a collection of Objects and is a sub-unit of a Track
({{model-track}}).  Groups SHOULD be independently useful, so Objects within a
Group SHOULD NOT depend on Objects in other Groups. A Group provides a join
point for subscriptions, so a subscriber that does not want to receive the
entire Track can opt to receive only Groups starting from a given Group ID.
Groups can contain any number of Objects.

### Group IDs

Within a track, the original publisher SHOULD publish Group IDs which increase
with time (where "time" is defined according to the internal clock of the media
being sent). In some cases, Groups will be produced in increasing order, but sent
to subscribers in a different order, for example when the subscription's Group
Order is Descending.  Due to network reordering and the partial reliability
features of MOQT, Groups can always be received out of order.

As a result, subscribers cannot infer the existence of a Group until an object in
the Group is received. This can create gaps in a cache that can be filled
by doing a Fetch upstream, if necessary.

Applications that cannot produce Group IDs that increase with time are limited
to the subset of MOQT that does not compare group IDs. Subscribers to these
Tracks SHOULD NOT use range filters which span multiple Groups in FETCH or
SUBSCRIBE.  SUBSCRIBE and FETCH delivery use Group Order, so they could have
an unexpected delivery order if Group IDs do not increase with time.

Note that the increase in time between two groups is not defined by the protocol.

## Track {#model-track}

A track is a sequence of groups ({{model-group}}). It is the entity
against which a subscriber issues a subscription request.  A subscriber
can request to receive individual tracks starting at a group boundary,
including any new objects pushed by the publisher while the track is
active.

### Track Naming {#track-name}

In MOQT, every track is identified by a Full Track Name, consisting of a Track
Namespace and a Track Name.

Track Namespace is an ordered set of between 1 and 32 Track Namespace Fields,
encoded as follows:

~~~
Track Namespace {
  Number of Track Namespace Fields (i),
  Track Namespace Field (..) ...
}
~~~

*  Number of Track Namespace Fields: A variable-length integer specifying
   the number of Track Namespace Fields in the Track Namespace.

Each Track Namespace Field is encoded as follows:

~~~
Track Namespace Field {
  Track Namespace Field Length (i),
  Track Namespace Field Value (..)
}
~~~

* Track Namespace Field Length: A variable-length integer specifying the length
  of the Track Namespace Field in bytes.

* Track Namespace Field Value: A sequence of bytes that forms a Track Namespace
  Field.

The structured nature of Track Namespace allows relays and applications to
manipulate prefixes of a namespace. If an endpoint receives a Track Namespace
consisting of 0 or greater than 32 Track Namespace Fields, it MUST close the
session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

Track Name is a sequence of bytes that identifies an individual track within the
namespace.

The maximum total length of a Full Track Name is 4,096 bytes. The length of a Full
Track Name is computed as the sum of the Track Namespace Field Length fields
and the Track Name Length field.  If an endpoint receives a Full Track Name
exceeding this length, it MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

In this specification, both the Track Namespace Fields and the Track Name
are not constrained to a specific encoding. They carry a sequence of bytes and
comparison between two Track Namespace Fields or Track Names is done by
exact comparison of the bytes. Specifications that use MOQT may constrain the
information in these fields, for example by restricting them to UTF-8. Any such
specification needs to specify the canonicalization into the bytes in the Track
Namespace Fields or Track Name such that exact comparison works.

### Malformed Tracks

There are multiple ways a publisher can transmit a Track that does not conform
to MOQT constraints. Such a Track is considered malformed.  Some example
conditions that constitute a malformed track when detected by a receiver
include:

1. An Object is received in a FETCH response with the same Group as the
   previous Object, but whose Object ID is not strictly larger than the previous
   object.
2. An Object is received in an Ascending FETCH response whose Group ID is smaller
   than the previous Object in the response.
3. An Object is received in a Descending FETCH response whose Group ID is larger
   than the previous Object in the resopnse.
4. An Object is received whose Object ID is larger than the final Object in the
   Subgroup.  The final Object in a Subgroup is the last Object received on a
   Subgroup stream before a FIN.
5. A Subgroup is received over multiple transport streams terminated by FIN with
   different final Objects.
6. An Object is received in a Group whose Object ID is larger than the final
   Object in the Group.  The final Object in a Group is the Object with Status
   END_OF_GROUP or the last Object sent in a FETCH that requested the entire
   Group.
7. An Object is received on a Track whose Group and Object ID are larger than the
   final Object in the Track.  The final Object in a Track is the Object with
   Status END_OF_TRACK or the last Object sent in a FETCH whose response indicated
   End of Track.
8. The same Object is received more than once with different Payload or
    other immutable properties.
9. An Object is received with a different Forwarding Preference than previously
    observed from the same Track.

The above list of conditions is not considered exhaustive.

When a subscriber detects a Malformed Track, it MUST UNSUBSCRIBE any
subscription and FETCH_CANCEL any fetch for that Track from that publisher, and
SHOULD deliver an error to the application.  If a relay detects a Malformed
Track, it MUST immediately terminate downstream subscriptions with PUBLISH_DONE
and reset any fetch streams with Status Code `MALFORMED_TRACK`.


### Scope {#track-scope}

An MOQT scope is a set of servers (as identified by their connection
URIs) for which a Full Track Name is guaranteed to be unique and identify a
specific track. It is up to the application using MOQT to define how broad or
narrow the scope is. An application that deals with connections between devices
on a local network may limit the scope to a single connection; by
contrast, an application that uses multiple CDNs to serve media may
require the scope to include all of those CDNs.

Because each Full Track Name is unique within an MOQT scope, they can be used as
a cache key for the track. If, at a given moment in time, two tracks within the
same scope contain different data, they MUST have different names and/or
namespaces. MOQT provides subscribers with the ability to alter the specific
manner in which tracks are delivered via Parameters, but the actual content of
the tracks does not depend on those parameters; this is in contrast to protocols
like HTTP, where request headers can alter the server response.

A publisher that loses state (e.g. crashes) and intends to resume publishing on
the same Track risks colliding with previously published Objects and violating
the above requirements.  A publisher can handle this in application specific
ways, for example:

1. Select a unique Track Name or Track Namespace whenever it resumes
   publishing. For example, it can base one of the Namespace Fields on the
   current time, or select a sufficiently large random value.
2. Resume publishing under a previous Track Name and Namespace and set the
   initial Group ID to a unique value guaranteed to be larger than all
   previously used groups.  This can be done by choosing a Group ID based on the
   current time.
3. Use TRACK_STATUS or similar mechanism to query the previous state to
   determine the largest published Group ID.

# Sessions {#session}

## Session establishment {#session-establishment}

This document defines a protocol that can be used interchangeably both
over a QUIC connection directly [QUIC], and over WebTransport
[WebTransport].  Both provide streams and datagrams with similar
semantics (see {{?I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview, Section 4}}); thus, the
main difference lies in how the servers are identified and how the
connection is established. The [QUIC-DATAGRAM] extension
MUST be supported and negotiated in the QUIC connection used for MOQT,
which is already a requirement for WebTransport over HTTP/3. The
RESET_STREAM_AT {{!I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset}}
extension to QUIC can be used by MOQT, but the protocol is also
designed to work correctly when the extension is not supported.

There is no definition of the protocol over other transports,
such as TCP, and applications using MoQ might need to fallback to
another protocol when QUIC or WebTransport aren't available.

### WebTransport

An MOQT server that is accessible via WebTransport can be identified
using an HTTPS URI ({{!RFC9110, Section 4.2.2}}).  An MOQT session can be
established by sending an extended CONNECT request to the host and the
path indicated by the URI, as described in
({{WebTransport, Section 3}}).

### QUIC

An MOQT server that is accessible via native QUIC can be identified by a
URI with a "moqt" scheme.  The "moqt" URI scheme is defined as follows,
using definitions from {{!RFC3986}}:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
moqt-URI = "moqt" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `authority` portion MUST NOT contain an empty `host` portion.
The `moqt` URI scheme supports the `/.well-known/` path prefix defined in
{{!RFC8615}}.

This protocol does not specify any semantics on the `path-abempty` and
`query` portions of the URI.  The contents of those are left up to the
application.

The client can establish a connection to an MOQT server identified by a given
URI by setting up a QUIC connection to the host and port identified by the
`authority` section of the URI. The `authority`, `path-abempty` and `query`
portions of the URI are also transmitted in SETUP parameters (see
{{setup-params}}).

The ALPN value {{!RFC7301}} used by the protocol is `moq-00`.

### Connection URL

Each track MAY have one or more associated connection URLs specifying
network hosts through which a track may be accessed. The syntax of the
Connection URL and the associated connection setup procedures are
specific to the underlying transport protocol usage (see {{session}}).

## Version and Extension Negotiation {#version-negotiation}

Endpoints use the exchange of Setup messages to negotiate the MOQT version and
any extensions to use.

The client indicates the MOQT versions it supports in the CLIENT_SETUP message
(see {{message-setup}}). It also includes the union of all Setup Parameters
(see {{setup-params}}) required for a handshake by any of those versions.

Within any MOQT version, clients request the use of extensions by adding Setup
parameters corresponding to that extension. No extensions are defined in this
document.

The server replies with a SERVER_SETUP message that indicates the chosen
version, includes all parameters required for a handshake in that version, and
parameters for every extension requested by the client that it supports.

New versions of MOQT MUST specify which existing extensions can be used with
that version. New extensions MUST specify the existing versions with which they
can be used.

If a given parameter carries the same information in multiple versions,
but might have different optimal values in those versions, there SHOULD be
separate Setup parameters for that information in each version.

## Session initialization {#session-init}

The first stream opened is a client-initiated bidirectional control stream where
the endpoints exchange Setup messages ({{message-setup}}), followed by other
messages defined in {{message}}.

This specification only specifies a single use of bidirectional streams. Objects
are sent on unidirectional streams.  Because there are no other uses of
bidirectional streams, a peer MAY close the session as a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` if
it receives a second bidirectional stream.

The control stream MUST NOT be closed at the underlying transport layer while the
session is active.  Doing so results in the session being closed as a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

## Termination  {#session-termination}

The Transport Session can be terminated at any point.  When native QUIC
is used, the session is closed using the CONNECTION\_CLOSE frame
({{QUIC, Section 19.19}}).  When WebTransport is used, the session is
closed using the CLOSE\_WEBTRANSPORT\_SESSION capsule ({{WebTransport,
Section 5}}).

When terminating the Session, the application MAY use any error message
and SHOULD use a relevant code, as defined below:

NO_ERROR (0x0):
: The session is being terminated without an error.

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x1):
: An implementation specific error occurred.

UNAUTHORIZED (0x2):
: The client is not authorized to establish a session.

PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (0x3):
: The remote endpoint performed an action that was disallowed by the
  specification.

INVALID_REQUEST_ID (0x4):
: The session was closed because the endpoint used a Request ID that was
  smaller than or equal to a previously received request ID, or the least-
  significant bit of the request ID was incorrect for the endpoint.

DUPLICATE_TRACK_ALIAS (0x5):
: The endpoint attempted to use a Track Alias that was already in use.

KEY_VALUE_FORMATTING_ERROR (0x6):
: The key-value pair has a formatting error.

TOO_MANY_REQUESTS (0x7):
: The session was closed because the endpoint used a Request ID equal to or
  larger than the current Maximum Request ID.

INVALID_PATH (0x8):
: The PATH parameter was used by a server, on a WebTransport session, or the
  server does not support the path.

MALFORMED_PATH (0x9):
: The PATH parameter does not conform to the rules in {{path}}.

GOAWAY_TIMEOUT (0x10):
: The session was closed because the peer took too long to close the session
  in response to a GOAWAY ({{message-goaway}}) message. See session migration
  ({{session-migration}}).

CONTROL_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT (0x11):
: The session was closed because the peer took too long to respond to a
  control message.

DATA_STREAM_TIMEOUT (0x12):
: The session was closed because the peer took too long to send data expected
  on an open Data Stream (see {{data-streams}}). This includes fields of a
  stream header or an object header within a data stream. If an endpoint
  times out waiting for a new object header on an open subgroup stream, it
  MAY send a STOP_SENDING on that stream or terminate the subscription.

AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_OVERFLOW (0x13):
: The Session limit {{max-auth-token-cache-size}} of the size of all
  registered Authorization tokens has been exceeded.

DUPLICATE_AUTH_TOKEN_ALIAS (0x14):
: Authorization Token attempted to register an Alias that was in use (see
  {{authorization-token}}).

VERSION_NEGOTIATION_FAILED (0x15):
: The client didn't offer a version supported by the server.

MALFORMED_AUTH_TOKEN (0x16):
: Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration (see
  {{authorization-token}}).

UNKNOWN_AUTH_TOKEN_ALIAS (0x17):
: No registered token found for the provided Alias (see
  {{authorization-token}}).

EXPIRED_AUTH_TOKEN (0x18):
: Authorization token has expired ({{authorization-token}}).

INVALID_AUTHORITY (0x19):
: The specified AUTHORITY does not correspond to this server or cannot be
  used in this context.

MALFORMED_AUTHORITY (0x1A):
: The AUTHORITY value is syntactically invalid.

An endpoint MAY choose to treat a subscription or request specific error as a
session error under certain circumstances, closing the entire session in
response to a condition with a single subscription or message. Implementations
need to consider the impact on other outstanding subscriptions before making
this choice.

## Migration {#session-migration}

MOQT requires a long-lived and stateful session. However, a service
provider needs the ability to shutdown/restart a server without waiting for all
sessions to drain naturally, as that can take days for long-form media.
MOQT enables proactively draining sessions via the GOAWAY message ({{message-goaway}}).

The server sends a GOAWAY message, signaling the client to establish a new
session and migrate any active subscriptions. The GOAWAY message optionally
contains a new URI for the new session, otherwise the current URI is
reused. The server SHOULD terminate the session with `GOAWAY_TIMEOUT` after a
sufficient timeout if there are still open subscriptions or fetches on a
connection.

When the server is a subscriber, it SHOULD send a GOAWAY message to downstream
subscribers prior to any UNSUBSCRIBE messages to upstream publishers.

After the client receives a GOAWAY, it's RECOMMENDED that the client waits until
there are no more active subscriptions before closing the session with NO_ERROR.
Ideally this is transparent to the application using MOQT, which involves
establishing a new session in the background and migrating active subscriptions
and published namespaces. The client can choose to delay closing the session if
it expects more OBJECTs to be delivered. The server closes the session with a
`GOAWAY_TIMEOUT` if the client doesn't close the session quickly enough.

## Congestion Control

MOQT does not specify a congestion controller, but there are important attributes
to consider when selecting a congestion controller for use with an application
built on top of MOQT.

### Bufferbloat

Traditional AIMD congestion controllers (ex. CUBIC {{?RFC9438}} and Reno {{?RFC6582}})
are prone to Bufferbloat. Bufferbloat occurs when elements along the path build up
a substantial queue of packets, commonly more than doubling the round trip time.
These queued packets cause head-of-line blocking and latency, even when there is
no packet loss.

### Application-Limited

The average bitrate for latency sensitive content needs to be less than the available
bandwidth, otherwise data will be queued and/or dropped. As such,
many MOQT applications will typically be limited by the available data to send, and
not the congestion controller. Many congestion control algorithms
only increase the congestion window or bandwidth estimate if fully utilized. This
combination can lead to underestimating the available network bandwidth. As a result,
applications might need to periodically ensure the congestion controller is not
app-limited for at least a full round trip to ensure the available bandwidth can be
measured.

### Consistent Throughput

Congestion control algorithms are commonly optimized for throughput, not consistency.
For example, BBR's PROBE_RTT state halves the sending rate for more than a round trip
in order to obtain an accurate minimum RTT. Similarly, Reno halves it's congestion
window upon detecting loss.  In both cases, the large reduction in sending rate might
cause issues with latency sensitive applications.

# Modularity

MOQT defines all messages necessary to implement both simple publishing or
subscribing endpoints as well as highly functional Relays.  Non-Relay endpoints
MAY implement only the subset of functionality required to perform necessary
tasks.  For example, a limited media player could operate using only SUBSCRIBE
related messages.  Limited endpoints SHOULD respond to any unsupported messages
with the appropriate `NOT_SUPPORTED` error code, rather than ignoring them.

Relays MUST implement all MOQT messages defined in this document, as well as
processing rules described in {{relays-moq}}.

# Publishing and Retrieving Tracks

## Subscriptions

A subscription can be initiated by either a publisher or a subscriber.  A
publisher initiates a subscription to a track by sending the PUBLISH message.
The subscriber either accepts or rejects the subscription using PUBLISH_OK or
REQUEST_ERROR.  A subscriber initiates a subscription to a track by sending the
SUBSCRIBE message.  The publisher either accepts or rejects the subscription
using SUBSCRIBE_OK or REQUEST_ERROR.  Once either of these sequences is
successful, the subscription can be updated by the subscriber using
SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE, terminated by the subscriber using UNSUBSCRIBE, or terminated
by the publisher using PUBLISH_DONE.

All subscriptions have a Forward State which is either 0 or 1.  If the Forward
State is 0, the publisher does not send objects for the subscription.  If the
Forward State is 1, the publisher sends objects.  The initiator of the
subscription sets the initial Forward State in either PUBLISH or SUBSCRIBE.  The
sender of PUBLISH_OK can update the Forward State based on its preference.  Once
the subscription is established, the subscriber can update the Forward State by
sending SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE.  Control messages, such as PUBLISH_DONE
({{message-publish-done}}) are still sent on subscriptions in Forward State 0.

Either endpoint can initiate a subscription to a track without exchanging any
prior messages other than SETUP.  Relays MUST NOT send any PUBLISH messages
without knowing the client is interested in and authorized to receive the
content. The communication of intent and authorization can be accomplished by
the client sending SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, or conveyed in other mechanisms out of
band.

An endpoint MAY SUBSCRIBE to a Track it is publishing, though only Relays are
required to handle such a SUBSCRIBE.  Such self-subscriptions are identical to
subscriptions initiated by other endpoints, and all published Objects will be
forwarded back to the endpoint, subject to priority and congestion response
rules.

A publisher MUST send exactly one SUBSCRIBE_OK or REQUEST_ERROR in response to
a SUBSCRIBE. A subscriber MUST send exactly one PUBLISH_OK or REQUEST_ERROR in
response to a PUBLISH. The peer SHOULD close the session with a protocol error
if it receives more than one.

A publisher SHOULD begin sending incomplete objects when available to avoid
incurring additional latency.

Publishers MAY start sending Objects on PUBLISH-initiated subscriptions before
receiving a PUBLISH_OK response to reduce latency.  Doing so can consume
unnecessary resources in cases where the Subscriber rejects the subscription
with REQUEST_ERROR or sets Forward State=0 in PUBLISH_OK. It can also result in
the Subscriber dropping Objects if its buffering limits are exceeded (see
{{datagrams}} and {{subgroup-header}}).

### Subscription State Management

A subscriber keeps subscription state until it sends UNSUBSCRIBE, or after
receipt of a PUBLISH_DONE or REQUEST_ERROR. Note that PUBLISH_DONE does not
usually indicate that state can immediately be destroyed, see
{{message-publish-done}}.

The Publisher can destroy subscription state as soon as it has received
UNSUBSCRIBE. It MUST reset any open streams associated with the SUBSCRIBE.

The publisher can immediately delete subscription state after sending
PUBLISH_DONE, but MUST NOT send it until it has closed all related streams.

A REQUEST_ERROR indicates no objects will be delivered, and both endpoints can
immediately destroy relevant state. Objects MUST NOT be sent for requests that
end with an error.

### Subscription Filters

The subscriber specifies a filter on the subscription to allow
the publisher to identify which objects need to be delivered.

All filters have a Start Location and an optional End Group.  Only objects
published or received via a subscription having Locations greater than or
equal to Start and strictly less than or equal to the End Group (when
present) pass the filter.

The `Largest Object` is defined to be the object with the largest Location
({{location-structure}}) in the track from the perspective of the endpoint
processing the SUBSCRIBE message. Largest Object updates when the first byte of
an Object with a larger Location than the previous value is published or
received through a subscription.

There are 4 types of filters:

Largest Object (0x2): The filter Start Location is `{Largest Object.Group,
Largest Object.Object + 1}` and `Largest Object` is communicated in
SUBSCRIBE_OK. If no content has been delivered yet, the filter Start Location is
{0, 0}. There is no End Group - the subscription is open ended.  Note that due
to network reordering or prioritization, relays can receive Objects with
Locations smaller than  `Largest Object` after the SUBSCRIBE is processed, but
these Objects do not pass the Largest Object filter.

Next Group Start (0x1): The filter Start Location is `{Largest Object.Group + 1,
0}` and `Largest Object` is communicated in SUBSCRIBE_OK. If no content has been
delivered yet, the filter Start Location is {0, 0}.  There is no End Group -
the subscription is open ended. For scenarios where the subscriber intends to
start from more than one group in the future, it can use an AbsoluteStart filter
instead.

AbsoluteStart (0x3):  The filter Start Location is specified explicitly in the
SUBSCRIBE message. The `Start` specified in the SUBSCRIBE message MAY be less
than the `Largest Object` observed at the publisher. There is no End Group - the
subscription is open ended.  To receive all Objects that are published or are
received after this subscription is processed, a subscriber can use an
AbsoluteStart filter with `Start` = {0, 0}.

AbsoluteRange (0x4):  The filer Start Location and End Group are specified
explicitly in the SUBSCRIBE message. The `Start` specified in the SUBSCRIBE
message MAY be less than the `Largest Object` observed at the publisher. If the
specified `End Group` is the same group specified in `Start`, the remainder of
that Group passes the filter. `End Group` MUST specify the same or a larger Group
than specified in `Start`.

An endpoint that receives a filter type other than the above MUST close the
session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

## Fetch State Management

The publisher MUST send exactly one FETCH_OK or REQUEST_ERROR in response to a
FETCH.

A subscriber keeps FETCH state until it sends FETCH_CANCEL, receives
REQUEST_ERROR, or receives a FIN or RESET_STREAM for the FETCH data stream. If the
data stream is already open, it MAY send STOP_SENDING for the data stream along
with FETCH_CANCEL, but MUST send FETCH_CANCEL.

The Publisher can destroy fetch state as soon as it has received a
FETCH_CANCEL. It MUST reset any open streams associated with the FETCH. It can
also destroy state after closing the FETCH data stream.

It can destroy all FETCH state after closing the data stream.

A REQUEST_ERROR indicates that both endpoints can immediately destroy state.
Since a relay can start delivering FETCH Objects from cache before determining
the result of the request, some Objects could be received even if the FETCH
results in error.


# Namespace Discovery {#track-discovery}

Discovery of MOQT servers is always done out-of-band. Namespace discovery can be
done in the context of an established MOQT session.

Given sufficient out of band information, it is valid for a subscriber to send a
SUBSCRIBE or FETCH message to a publisher (including a relay) without any
previous MOQT messages besides SETUP. However, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH and
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages provide an in-band means of discovery of publishers
for a namespace.

The syntax of these messages is described in {{message}}.


## Subscribing to Namespaces

If the subscriber is aware of a namespace of interest, it can send
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE to publishers/relays it has established a session with. The
recipient of this message will send any relevant PUBLISH_NAMESPACE,
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE or PUBLISH messages for that namespace, or more specific
part of that namespace.  This includes echoing back PUBLISH or PUBLISH_NAMESPACE
messages to the endpoint that sent them.  If an endpoint accepts its own
PUBLISH, this behaves as self-subscription described in {{subscriptions}}.

A publisher MUST send exactly one SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or
REQUEST_ERROR in response to a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE. The subscriber
SHOULD close the session with a protocol error if it detects receiving more than
one.

The receiver of a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or REQUEST_ERROR ought to
forward the result to the application, so the application can decide which other
publishers to contact, if any.

An UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE withdraws a previous SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE. It does not
prohibit original publishers from sending further PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or PUBLISH
messages, but relays MUST NOT send any further PUBLISH messages to a client
without knowing the client is interested in and authorized to receive the
content.

## Publishing Namespaces

A publisher MAY send PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages to any subscriber. A
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE indicates to the subscriber that the publisher has tracks
available in that namespace. A subscriber MAY send SUBSCRIBE or FETCH for tracks
in a namespace without having received a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE for it.

If a publisher is authoritative for a given namespace, or is a relay that has
received an authorized PUBLISH_NAMESPACE for that namespace from an upstream
publisher, it MUST send a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE to any subscriber that has
subscribed via SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE for that namespace, or a prefix of that
namespace. A publisher MAY send the PUBLISH_NAMESPACE to any other subscriber.

An endpoint SHOULD report the reception of a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK or
REQUEST_ERROR to the application to inform the search for additional
subscribers for a namespace, or to abandon the attempt to publish under this
namespace. This might be especially useful in upload or chat applications. A
subscriber MUST send exactly one PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK or REQUEST_ERROR
in response to a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE. The publisher SHOULD close the session with
a protocol error if it receives more than one.

A PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE message withdraws a previous PUBLISH_NAMESPACE,
although it is not a protocol error for the subscriber to send a SUBSCRIBE or
FETCH message for a track in a namespace after receiving an
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE.

A subscriber can send PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL to revoke acceptance of an
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, for example due to expiration of authorization
credentials. The message enables the publisher to PUBLISH_NAMESPACE again with
refreshed authorization, or discard associated state. After receiving an
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL, the publisher does not send PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE.

While PUBLISH_NAMESPACE indicates to relays how to connect publishers and
subscribers, it is not a full-fledged routing protocol and does not protect
against loops and other phenomena. In particular, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE SHOULD NOT
be used to find paths through richly connected networks of relays.

A subscriber MAY send a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH for a track to any publisher. If it
has accepted a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE with a namespace that exactly matches the
namespace for that track, it SHOULD only request it from the senders of those
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages.


# Priorities {#priorities}

MoQ priorities allow a subscriber and original publisher to influence
the transmission order of Objects within a session in the presence of
congestion.

## Definitions

MOQT maintains priorities between different _schedulable objects_.
A schedulable object in MOQT is either:

1. The first or next Object in a Subgroup that is in response to a subscription.
2. An Object in response to a subscription that belongs to a Track with
   delivery preference Datagram.
3. An Object in response to a FETCH where that Object is the next
   Object in the response.

An Object is not schedulable if it is known that no part of it can be written
due to underlying transport flow control limits.

A single subgroup or datagram has a single publisher priority. Within a
response to SUBSCRIBE, it can be useful to conceptualize this process as
scheduling subgroups or datagrams instead of individual objects on them.
FETCH responses however can contain objects with different publisher
priorities.

A _priority number_ is an unsigned integer with a value between 0 and 255.
A lower priority number indicates higher priority; the highest priority is 0.

_Subscriber Priority_ is a priority number associated with an individual
request.  It is specified in the SUBSCRIBE or FETCH message, and can be
updated via SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE message.  The subscriber priority of an individual
schedulable object is the subscriber priority of the request that caused that
object to be sent. When subscriber priority is changed, a best effort SHOULD be
made to apply the change to all objects that have not been scheduled, but it is
implementation dependent what happens to objects that have already been
scheduled.

_Publisher Priority_ is a priority number associated with an individual
schedulable object.  A default can be specified in the parameters of PUBLISH, or
SUBSCRIBE_OK. Publisher priority can also be specified in a subgroup header or
datagram (see {{data-streams}}).

_Group Order_ is a property of an individual subscription.  It can be either
'Ascending' (groups with lower group ID are sent first), or 'Descending'
(groups with higher group ID are sent first).  The subscriber optionally
communicates its group order preference in the SUBSCRIBE message; the
publisher's preference is used if the subscriber did not express one (by
setting Group Order field to value 0x0).  The group order of an existing
subscription cannot be changed.

## Scheduling Algorithm

When an MOQT publisher has multiple schedulable objects it can choose between,
the objects SHOULD be selected as follows:

1. If two objects have different subscriber priorities associated with them,
   the one with **the highest subscriber priority** is scheduled to be sent first.
1. If two objects have the same subscriber priority, but different publisher
   priorities, the one with **the highest publisher priority** is scheduled to be
   sent first.
2. If two objects in response to the same request have the same subscriber
   and publisher priority, but belong to two different groups of the same track,
   **the group order** of the associated subscription is used to
   decide the one that is scheduled to be sent first.
3. If two objects in response to the same request have the same subscriber
   and publisher priority and belong to the same group of the same track, the
   one with **the lowest Subgroup ID** (for tracks with delivery preference
   Subgroup), or **the lowest Object ID** (for tracks with delivery preference
   Datagram) is scheduled to be sent first.

The definition of "scheduled to be sent first" in the algorithm is implementation
dependent and is constrained by the prioritization interface of the underlying
transport. For some implementations, it could mean that the object is serialized
and passed to the underlying transport first.  Other implementations can
control the order packets are initially transmitted.

This algorithm does not provide a well-defined ordering for objects that belong
to different subscriptions or FETCH responses, but have the same subscriber and
publisher priority.  The ordering in those cases is implementation-defined,
though the expectation is that all subscriptions will be able to send some data.

Given the critical nature of control messages and their relatively
small size, the control stream SHOULD be prioritized higher than all
subscribed Objects.

## Considerations for Setting Priorities

For downstream subscriptions, relays SHOULD respect the subscriber and original
publisher's priorities.  Relays can receive subscriptions with conflicting
subscriber priorities or Group Order preferences.  Relays SHOULD NOT directly
use Subscriber Priority or Group Order from incoming subscriptions for upstream
subscriptions. Relays' use of these fields for upstream subscriptions can be
based on factors specific to it, such as the popularity of the content or
policy, or relays can specify the same value for all upstream subscriptions.

MoQ Sessions can span multiple namespaces, and priorities might not
be coordinated across namespaces.  The subscriber's priority is
considered first, so there is a mechanism for a subscriber to fix
incompatibilities between different namespaces prioritization schemes.
Additionally, it is anticipated that when multiple namespaces
are present within a session, the namespaces could be coordinating,
possibly part of the same application.  In cases when pooling among
namespaces is expected to cause issues, multiple MoQ sessions, either
within a single connection or on multiple connections can be used.

Implementations that have a default priority SHOULD set it to a value in
the middle of the range (eg: 128) to allow non-default priorities to be
set either higher or lower.

# Relays {#relays-moq}

Relays are leveraged to enable distribution scale in the MoQ
architecture. Relays can be used to form an overlay delivery network,
similar in functionality to Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs). Additionally, relays serve as policy enforcement points by
validating subscribe and publish requests at the edge of a network.

Relays are endpoints, which means they terminate Transport Sessions in order to
have visibility of MoQ Object metadata.

## Caching Relays

Relays MAY cache Objects, but are not required to.

A caching relay saves Objects to its cache identified by the Object's Full Track
Name, Group ID and Object ID. If multiple objects are received with the same
Full Track Name, Group ID and Object ID, Relays MAY ignore subsequently received
Objects or MAY use them to update certain cached fields. Implementations that
update the cache need to protect against cache poisoning.  The only Object
fields that can be updated are the following:

1. Object Status can transition from any status to Object Does Not Exist in
   cases where the object is no longer available.  Transitions between Normal,
   End of Group and End of Track are invalid.
3. Object Header Extensions can be added, removed or updated, subject
   to the constraints of the specific header extension.

An endpoint that receives a duplicate Object with an invalid Object Status
change, or with a different Forwarding Preference, Subgroup ID, Priority or
Payload MUST treat the track as Malformed.

Note that due to reordering, an implementation can receive a duplicate Object
with a status of Normal, End of Group or End of Track after receiving a previous
status of Object Does Not Exist.  The endpoint SHOULD NOT cache or forward the
duplicate object in this case.

A cache MUST store all properties of an Object defined in
{{object-properties}}, with the exception of any extensions
({{object-extensions}}) that specify otherwise.

## Forward Handling

Relays SHOULD set the `Forward` flag to 1 when a new subscription needs to be
sent upstream, regardless of the value of the `Forward` field from the
downstream subscription. Subscriptions that are not forwarded consume resources
from the publisher, so a publisher might deprioritize, reject, or close those
subscriptions to ensure other subscriptions can be delivered.

## Multiple Publishers

A Relay can receive PUBLISH_NAMESPACE for the same Track Namespace or PUBLISH
messages for the same Track from multiple publishers.  The following sections
explain how Relays maintain subscriptions to all available publishers for a
given Track.

There is no specified limit to the number of publishers of a Track Namespace or
Track.  An implementation can use mechanisms such as REQUEST_ERROR,
UNSUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL if it cannot
accept an additional publisher due to implementation constraints.
Implementations can consider the establishment or idle time of the session or
subscription to determine which publisher to reject or disconnect.

Relays MUST handle Objects for the same Track from multiple publishers and
forward them to active matching subscriptions. The Relay SHOULD attempt to
deduplicate Objects before forwarding, subject to implementation constraints.

## Subscriber Interactions

Subscribers request Tracks by sending a SUBSCRIBE (see
{{message-subscribe-req}}) or FETCH (see {{message-fetch}}) control message for
each Track of interest. Relays MUST ensure subscribers are authorized to access
the content associated with the Track. The authorization information can be part
of request itself or part of the encompassing session. The specifics of how a
relay authorizes a user are outside the scope of this specification.

The relay MUST have an established upstream subscription before sending
SUBSCRIBE_OK in response to a downstream SUBSCRIBE.  If a relay does not have
sufficient information to send a FETCH_OK immediately in response to a FETCH, it
MUST withhold sending FETCH_OK until it does.

For successful subscriptions, the publisher maintains a list of subscribers for
each Track. Relays use the Track Alias ({{track-alias}}) of an incoming Object
to identify its Track and find the active subscribers.  Each new Object
belonging to the Track is forwarded to each active subscriber, as allowed by the
subscription's filter (see {{message-subscribe-req}}), and delivered according
to the priority (see {{priorities}}) and delivery timeout (see
{{delivery-timeout}}).

A relay MUST NOT reorder or drop objects received on a multi-object stream when
forwarding to subscribers, unless it has application specific information.

Relays MAY aggregate authorized subscriptions for a given Track when
multiple subscribers request the same Track. Subscription aggregation
allows relays to make only a single upstream subscription for the
Track. The published content received from the upstream subscription
request is cached and shared among the pending subscribers.
Because SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE only allows narrowing a subscription, relays that
aggregate upstream subscriptions can subscribe using the Largest Object
filter to avoid churn as downstream subscribers with disparate filters
subscribe and unsubscribe from a Track.

A subscriber remains subscribed to a Track at a Relay until it unsubscribes, the
upstream publisher terminates the subscription, or the subscription expires (see
{{message-subscribe-ok}}).  A subscription with a filter can reach a state where
all possible Objects matching the filter have been delivered to the subscriber.
Since tracking this can be prohibitively expensive, Relays are not required or
expected to do so.

### Graceful Subscriber Relay Switchover

This section describes behavior a subscriber MAY implement
to allow for a better user experience when a relay sends a GOAWAY.

When a subscriber receives the GOAWAY message, it starts the process
of connecting to a new relay and sending the SUBSCRIBE requests for
all active subscriptions to the new relay. The new relay will send a
response to the subscribes and if they are successful, the subscriptions
to the old relay can be stopped with an UNSUBSCRIBE.


## Publisher Interactions

There are two ways to publish through a relay:

1. Send a PUBLISH message for a specific Track to the relay. The relay MAY
respond with PUBLISH_OK in Forward State=0 until there are known subscribers for
new Tracks.

2. Send a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE message for a Track Namespace to the relay. This
enables the relay to send SUBSCRIBE or FETCH messages to publishers for Tracks
in this Namespace in response to requests received from subscribers.

Relays MUST verify that publishers are authorized to publish the set of Tracks
whose Track Namespace matches the namespace in a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, or the Full
Track Name in PUBLISH. The authorization and identification of the publisher
depends on the way the relay is managed and is application specific.

When a publisher wants to stop new subscriptions for a published namespace it
sends a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE. A subscriber indicates it will no longer
subcribe to Tracks in a namespace it previously responded PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK
to by sending a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL.

A Relay connects publishers and subscribers by managing sessions based on the
Track Namespace or Full Track Name. When a SUBSCRIBE message is sent, its Full
Track Name is matched exactly against existing upstream subscriptions.

Namespace Prefix Matching is further used to decide which publishers receive a
SUBSCRIBE and which subscribers receive a PUBLISH. In this process, the fields
in the Track Namespace are matched sequentially, requiring an exact match for
each field. If the published or subscribed Track Namespace has the same or fewer
fields than the Track Namespace in the message, it qualifies as a match.

For example:
A SUBSCRIBE message with namespace=(foo, bar) and name=x will match sessions
that sent PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages with namespace=(foo) or namespace=(foo,
bar).  It will not match a session with namespace=(foobar).

Relays MUST forward SUBSCRIBE messages to all matching publishers and
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or PUBLISH messages to all matching subscribers.

When a Relay needs to make an upstream FETCH request, it determines the
available publishers using the same matching rules as SUBSCRIBE. When more than
one publisher is available, the Relay MAY send the FETCH to any of them.

When a Relay receives an authorized SUBSCRIBE for a Track with one or more
active upstream subscriptions, it MUST reply with SUBSCRIBE_OK.  If the
SUBSCRIBE has Forward State=1 and the upstream subscriptions are in Forward
State=0, the Relay MUST send SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE with Forward=1 to all publishers.
If there are no active upstream subscriptions for the requested Track, the Relay
MUST send a SUBSCRIBE request to each publisher that has published the
subscription's namespace or prefix thereof.  If the SUBSCRIBE has Forward
=1, then the Relay MUST use Forward=1 when subscribing upstream.

When a relay receives an incoming PUBLISH message, it MUST send a PUBLISH
request to each subscriber that has subscribed (via SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE)
to the Track's namespace or prefix thereof.

When a relay receives an authorized PUBLISH_NAMESPACE for a namespace that
matches one or more existing subscriptions to other upstream sessions, it MUST
send a SUBSCRIBE to the publisher that sent the PUBLISH_NAMESPACE for each
matching subscription.  When it receives an authorized PUBLISH message for a
Track that has active subscribers, it MUST respond with PUBLISH_OK.  If at least
one downstream subscriber for the Track has Forward State=1, the Relay MUST use
Forward State=1 in the reply.

If a Session is closed due to an unknown or invalid control message or Object,
the Relay MUST NOT propagate that message or Object to another Session, because
it would enable a single Session error to force an unrelated Session, which
might be handling other subscriptions, to be closed.

### Graceful Publisher Network Switchover

This section describes a behavior that a publisher MAY
choose to implement to allow for a better user experience when
switching between networks, such as WiFi to Cellular or vice versa.

If the original publisher detects it is likely to need to switch networks, for
example because the WiFi signal is getting weaker, and it does not have QUIC
connection migration available, it establishes a new session over the new
interface and sends PUBLISH_NAMESPACE and/or PUBLISH messages. The relay will
establish subscriptions and the publisher publishes Objects on both sessions.
Once the subscriptions have migrated over to the session on the new network, the
publisher can stop publishing Objects on the old network. The relay will attempt
to deduplicate Objects received on both subscriptions. Ideally, the
subscriptions downstream from the relay do not observe this change, and keep
receiving the Objects on the same subscription.

### Graceful Publisher Relay Switchover

This section describes a behavior that a publisher MAY choose to implement
to allow for a better user experience when a relay sends them a GOAWAY.

When a publisher receives a GOAWAY, it starts the process of connecting to a new
relay and sends PUBLISH_NAMESPACE and/or PUBLISH messages, but it does not
immediately stop publishing Objects to the old Relay. The new Relay will
establish subscriptions and the publisher can start sending new Objects to the
new relay instead of the old Relay. Once Objects are going to the new Relay, the
published namespaces and subscriptions to the old relay can be withdrawn or
terminated.

## Relay Object Handling

MOQT encodes the delivery information via Object headers
({{message-object}}).  A relay MUST NOT modify Object properties when
forwarding, except for Object Extension Headers as specified in
{{object-extensions}}.

A relay MUST treat the object payload as opaque.  A relay MUST NOT
combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.  A relay SHOULD
prioritize sending Objects based on {{priorities}}.

# Control Messages {#message}

MOQT uses a single bidirectional stream to exchange control messages, as
defined in {{session-init}}.  Every single message on the control stream is
formatted as follows:

~~~
MOQT Control Message {
  Message Type (i),
  Message Length (16),
  Message Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-message-format title="MOQT Control Message"}

The following Message Types are defined:

|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|

An endpoint that receives an unknown message type MUST close the session.
Control messages have a length to make parsing easier, but no control messages
are intended to be ignored. The length is set to the number of bytes in Message
Payload, which is defined by each message type.  If the length does not match
the length of the Message Payload, the receiver MUST close the session with a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

## Request ID

Most MOQT control messages contain a session specific Request ID.  The Request
ID correlates requests and responses, allows endpoints to update or terminate
ongoing requests, and supports the endpoint's ability to limit the concurrency
and frequency of requests.  Request IDs for one endpoint increment independently
from those sent by the peer endpoint.  The client's Request ID starts at 0 and
are even and the server's Request ID starts at 1 and are odd.  The Request ID
increments by 2 with each FETCH, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE,
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or TRACK_STATUS request.
Other messages with a Request ID field reference the Request ID of another
message for correlation. If an endpoint receives a Request ID that is not valid
for the peer, or a new request with a Request ID that is not the next in
sequence or exceeds the received MAX_REQUEST_ID, it MUST close the session with
`INVALID_REQUEST_ID`.

## Parameters {#params}

Some messages include a Parameters field that encodes optional message
elements.

Senders MUST NOT repeat the same parameter type in a message unless the
parameter definition explicitly allows multiple instances of that type to
be sent in a single message. Receivers SHOULD check that there are no
unauthorized duplicate parameters and close the session as a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` if found.  Receivers MUST allow duplicates of unknown
parameters.

The Parameters in SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH_OK and FETCH MUST NOT cause the publisher
to alter the payload of the objects it sends, as that would violate the track
uniqueness guarantee described in {{track-scope}}.

Receivers ignore unrecognized parameters.

The number of parameters in a message is not specifically limited, but the
total length of a control message is limited to 2^16-1 bytes.

Parameters are serialized as Key-Value-Pairs {{moq-key-value-pair}}.

Setup message parameters use a namespace that is constant across all MOQT
versions. All other messages use a version-specific namespace.
For example, the integer '1' can refer to different parameters for Setup
messages and for all other message types. SETUP message parameter types
are defined in {{setup-params}}. Version-specific parameter types are defined
in {{version-specific-params}}.

### Version Specific Parameters {#version-specific-params}

Each version-specific parameter definition indicates the message types in which
it can appear. If it appears in some other type of message, it MUST be ignored.
Note that since Setup parameters use a separate namespace, it is impossible for
these parameters to appear in Setup messages.

#### AUTHORIZATION TOKEN {#authorization-token}

The AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter (Parameter Type 0x03) MAY appear in a
CLIENT_SETUP, SERVER_SETUP, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE,
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, TRACK_STATUS or FETCH message. This
parameter conveys information to authorize the sender to perform the operation
carrying the parameter.

The AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter MAY be repeated within a message.

The parameter value is a Token structure containing an optional Session-specific
Alias. The Alias allows the sender to reference a previously transmitted Token
Type and Token Value in future messages. The Token structure is serialized as
follows:

~~~
Token {
  Alias Type (i),
  [Token Alias (i),]
  [Token Type (i),]
  [Token Value (..)]
}
~~~
{: #moq-token format title="Token structure"}

* Alias Type - an integer defining both the serialization and the processing
  behavior of the receiver. This Alias type has the following code points:

DELETE (0x0):
: There is an Alias but no Type or Value. This Alias and the Token Value it was
previously associated with| MUST be retired. Retiring removes them from the pool
of actively registered tokens.

REGISTER (0x1):
: There is an Alias, a Type and a Value. This Alias MUST be associated with the
Token Value for the duration of the Session or it is deleted. This action is
termed "registering" the Token.

USE_ALIAS (0x2):
: There is an Alias but no Type or Value. Use the Token Type and Value
previously registered with this Alias.

USE_VALUE (0x3):
: There is no Alias and there is a Type and Value. Use the Token Value as
provided. The Token Value may be discarded after processing.

* Token Alias - a Session-specific integer identifier that references a Token
  Value. There are separate Alias spaces for the client and server (e.g.: they
  can each register Alias=1). Once a Token Alias has been registered, it cannot
  be re-registered by the same endpoint in the Session without first being
  deleted. Use of the Token Alias is optional.

* Token Type - a numeric identifier for the type of Token payload being
  transmitted. This type is defined by the IANA table "MOQT Auth Token Type" (see
  {{iana}}). Type 0 is reserved to indicate that the type is not defined in the
  table and is negotiated out-of-band between client and receiver.

* Token Value - the payload of the Token. The contents and serialization of this
  payload are defined by the Token Type.

If the Token structure cannot be decoded, the receiver MUST close the Session
with `KEY_VALUE_FORMATTING_ERROR`.  The receiver of a message attempting to
register an Alias which is already registered MUST close the Session with
`DUPLICATE_AUTH_TOKEN_ALIAS`. The receiver of a message referencing an Alias
that is not currently registered MUST reject the message with
`UNKNOWN_AUTH_TOKEN_ALIAS`.

The receiver of a message containing a well-formed Token structure but otherwise
invalid AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter MUST reject that message with an
`MALFORMED_AUTH_TOKEN` error.

The receiver of a message carrying an AUTHORIZATION TOKEN with Alias Type
REGISTER that does not result in a Session error MUST register the Token Alias,
in the token cache, even if the message fails for other reasons, including
`Unauthorized`.  This allows senders to pipeline messages that refer to
previously registered tokens without potentially terminating the entire Session.
A receiver MAY store an error code (eg: `UNAUTHORIZED` or
`MALFORMED_AUTH_TOKEN`) in place of the Token Type and Token Alias if any future
message referencing the Token Alias will result in that error. The size of a
registered cache entry includes the length of the Token Value, regardless of
whether it is stored.

If a receiver detects that an authorization token has expired, it MUST retain
the registered Alias until it is deleted by the sender, though it MAY discard
other state associated with the token that is no longer needed.  Expiration does
not affect the size occupied by a token in the token cache.  Any message that
references the token with Alias Type USE_ALIAS fails with `EXPIRED_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Using an Alias to refer to a previously registered Token Type and Value is for
efficiency only and has the same effect as if the Token Type and Value was
included directly.  Retiring an Alias that was previously used to authorize a
message has no retroactive effect on the original authorization, nor does it
prevent that same Token Type and Value from being re-registered.

Senders of tokens SHOULD only register tokens which they intend to re-use during
the Session and SHOULD retire previously registered tokens once their utility
has passed.

By registering a Token, the sender is requiring the receiver to store the Token
Alias and Token Value until they are deleted, or the Session ends. The receiver
can protect its resources by sending a SETUP parameter defining the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE limit (see {{max-auth-token-cache-size}}) it is
willing to accept. If a registration is attempted which would cause this limit
to be exceeded, the receiver MUST termiate the Session with a
`AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_OVERFLOW` error.


#### DELIVERY TIMEOUT Parameter {#delivery-timeout}

The DELIVERY TIMEOUT parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) MAY appear in a
TRACK_STATUS, TRACK_STATUS_OK, PUBLISH, PUBLISH_OK, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_OK, or
SUBSCRIBE_UDPATE message.  It is the duration in milliseconds the relay SHOULD
continue to attempt forwarding Objects after they have been received.  The start
time for the timeout is based on when the Object Headers are received, and does
not depend upon the forwarding preference. There is no explicit signal that an
Object was not sent because the delivery timeout was exceeded.

If both the subscriber and publisher specify the parameter, they use the min of
the two values for the subscription.  The publisher SHOULD always specify the
value received from an upstream subscription when there is one, and nothing
otherwise.

Publishers can, at their discretion, discontinue forwarding Objects earlier than
the negotiated DELIVERY TIMEOUT, subject to stream closure and ordering
constraints described in {{closing-subgroup-streams}}.  However, if neither the
subscriber nor publisher specifies DELIVERY TIMEOUT, all Objects in the track
matching the subscription filter are delivered as indicated by their Group Order
and Priority.  If a subscriber fails to consume Objects at a sufficient rate,
causing the publisher to exceed its resource limits, the publisher MAY terminate
the subscription with error `TOO_FAR_BEHIND`.

If an object in a subgroup exceeds the delivery timeout, the publisher MUST
reset the underlying transport stream (see {{closing-subgroup-streams}}).

When sent by a subscriber, this parameter is intended to be specific to a
subscription, so it SHOULD NOT be forwarded upstream by a relay that intends
to serve multiple subscriptions for the same track.

Publishers SHOULD consider whether the entire Object can likely be
successfully delivered within the timeout period before sending any data
for that Object, taking into account priorities, congestion control, and
any other relevant information.

#### MAX CACHE DURATION Parameter {#max-cache-duration}

The MAX_CACHE_DURATION parameter (Parameter Type 0x04) MAY appear in a PUBLISH,
SUBSCRIBE_OK, FETCH_OK or TRACK_STATUS_OK message.  It is an integer expressing
the number of milliseconds an object can be served from a cache. If present, the
relay MUST NOT start forwarding any individual Object received through this
subscription or fetch after the specified number of milliseconds has elapsed
since the beginning of the Object was received.  This means Objects earlier in a
multi-object stream will expire earlier than Objects later in the stream. Once
Objects have expired from cache, their state becomes unknown, and a relay that
handles a downstream request that includes those Objects re-requests them.

#### PUBLISHER PRIORITY Parameter {#subscriber-priority}

The PUBLISHER PRIORITY parameter (Parameter Type 0x0E) specifies the priority of
a subscription relative to other subscriptions in the same session.  The value
is from 0 to 255 and lower numbers get higher priority.  See
{{priorities}}. Priorities above 255 are invalid. The PUBLISHER PRIORITY
parameter is valid in SUBSCRIBE_OK and PUBLISH. Subgroups and Datagrams for this
subscription inherit this priority, unless they specifically override it.

The subscription has Publisher Priorty 128 if this parameter is omitted.

## CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP {#message-setup}

The `CLIENT_SETUP` and `SERVER_SETUP` messages are the first messages exchanged
by the client and the server; they allow the endpoints to establish the mutually
supported version and agree on the initial configuration before any objects are
exchanged. It is a sequence of key-value pairs called Setup parameters; the
semantics and format of which can vary based on whether the client or server is
sending.  To ensure future extensibility of MOQT, endpoints MUST ignore unknown
setup parameters. TODO: describe GREASE for those.

The wire format of the Setup messages are as follows:

~~~
CLIENT_SETUP Message {
  Type (i) = 0x20,
  Length (16),
  Number of Supported Versions (i),
  Supported Versions (i) ...,
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Setup Parameters (..) ...,
}

SERVER_SETUP Message {
  Type (i) = 0x21,
  Length (16),
  Selected Version (i),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Setup Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-setup-format title="MOQT Setup Messages"}

The available versions and Setup parameters are detailed in the next sections.

### Versions {#setup-versions}

MOQT versions are a 32-bit unsigned integer, encoded as a varint.
This version of the specification is identified by the number 0x00000001.
Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the version number cleared are
reserved for use in future IETF consensus documents.

The client offers the list of the protocol versions it supports; the
server MUST reply with one of the versions offered by the client. If the
server does not support any of the versions offered by the client, or
the client receives a server version that it did not offer, the
corresponding peer MUST close the session with `VERSION_NEGOTIATION_FAILED`.

\[\[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before
publication.]]

The version number for the final version of this specification (0x00000001), is
reserved for the version of the protocol that is published as an RFC.
Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts are created by adding the draft
number to 0xff000000. For example, draft-ietf-moq-transport-13 would be
identified as 0xff00000D.

### Setup Parameters {#setup-params}

#### AUTHORITY {#authority}

The AUTHORITY parameter (Parameter Type 0x05) allows the client to specify the
authority component of the MoQ URI when using native QUIC ({{QUIC}}).  It MUST
NOT be used by the server, or when WebTransport is used.  When an AUTHORITY
parameter is received from a server, or when an AUTHORITY parameter is received
while WebTransport is used, or when an AUTHORITY parameter is received by a
server but the server does not support the specified authority, the session MUST
be closed with `INVALID_AUTHORITY`.

The AUTHORITY parameter follows the URI formatting rules {{!RFC3986}}.
When connecting to a server using a URI with the "moqt" scheme, the
client MUST set the AUTHORITY parameter to the `authority` portion of the
URI. If an AUTHORITY parameter does not conform to
these rules, the session MUST be closed with `MALFORMED_AUTHORITY`.

#### PATH {#path}

The PATH parameter (Parameter Type 0x01) allows the client to specify the path
of the MoQ URI when using native QUIC ({{QUIC}}).  It MUST NOT be used by
the server, or when WebTransport is used.  When a PATH parameter is received
from a server, or when a PATH parameter is received while WebTransport is used,
or when a PATH parameter is received by a server but the server does not
support the specified path, the session MUST be closed with `INVALID_PATH`.

The PATH parameter follows the URI formatting rules {{!RFC3986}}.
When connecting to a server using a URI with the "moqt" scheme, the
client MUST set the PATH parameter to the `path-abempty` portion of the
URI; if `query` is present, the client MUST concatenate `?`, followed by
the `query` portion of the URI to the parameter. If a PATH does not conform to
these rules, the session MUST be closed with `MALFORMED_PATH`.

#### MAX_REQUEST_ID {#max-request-id}

The MAX_REQUEST_ID parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) communicates an initial
value for the Maximum Request ID to the receiving endpoint. The default
value is 0, so if not specified, the peer MUST NOT send requests.

#### MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE {#max-auth-token-cache-size}

The MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter (Parameter Type 0x04) communicates the
maximum size in bytes of all actively registered Authorization tokens that the
endpoint is willing to store per Session. This parameter is optional. The default
value is 0 which prohibits the use of token Aliases.

The token size is calculated as 16 bytes + the size of the Token Value field
(see {{moq-token}}). The total size as restricted by the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter is calculated as the sum of the token sizes
for all registered tokens (Alias Type value of 0x01) minus the sum of the token
sizes for all deregistered tokens (Alias Type value of 0x00), since Session
initiation.

#### AUTHORIZATION TOKEN {#setup-auth-token}

See {{authorization-token}}.  The endpoint can specify one or more tokens in
CLIENT_SETUP or SERVER_SETUP that the peer can use to authorize MOQT session
establishment.

If a server receives an AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter in CLIENT_SETUP with Alias
Type REGISTER that exceeds its MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE, it MUST NOT fail
the session with `AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_OVERFLOW`.  Instead, it MUST treat the
parameter as Alias Type USE_VALUE.  A client MUST handle registration failures
of this kind by purging any Token Aliases that failed to register based on the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter in SERVER_SETUP (or the default value of 0).

#### MOQT IMPLEMENTATION

The MOQT_IMPLEMENTATION parameter (Parameter Type 0x07) identifies the name and
version of the sender's MOQT implementation.  This SHOULD be a UTF-8 encoded
string [RFC3629], though the message does not carry information, such as
language tags, that would aid comprehension by any entity other than the one
that created the text.


## GOAWAY {#message-goaway}

An endpoint sends a `GOAWAY` message to inform the peer it intends to close
the session soon.  Servers can use GOAWAY to initiate session migration
({{session-migration}}) with an optional URI.

The GOAWAY message does not impact subscription state. A subscriber
SHOULD individually UNSUBSCRIBE for each existing subscription, while a
publisher MAY reject new requests after sending a GOAWAY.

Upon receiving a GOAWAY, an endpoint SHOULD NOT initiate new requests to the
peer including SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, FETCH, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE,
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE and TRACK_SATUS.

The endpoint MUST terminate the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`
({{session-termination}}) if it receives multiple GOAWAY messages.

~~~
GOAWAY Message {
  Type (i) = 0x10,
  Length (16),
  New Session URI Length (i),
  New Session URI (..),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-goaway-format title="MOQT GOAWAY Message"}

* New Session URI: When received by a client, indicates where the client can
  connect to continue this session.  The client MUST use this URI for the new
  session if provided. If the URI is zero bytes long, the current URI is reused
  instead. The new session URI SHOULD use the same scheme
  as the current URI to ensure compatibility.  The maxmimum length of the New
  Session URI is 8,192 bytes.  If an endpoint receives a length exceeding the
  maximum, it MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

  If a server receives a GOAWAY with a non-zero New Session URI Length it MUST
  terminate the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

## MAX_REQUEST_ID {#message-max-request-id}

An endpoint sends a MAX_REQUEST_ID message to increase the number of requests
the peer can send within a session.

The Maximum Request ID MUST only increase within a session, and
receipt of a MAX_REQUEST_ID message with an equal or smaller Request ID
value is a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

~~~
MAX_REQUEST_ID Message {
  Type (i) = 0x15,
  Length (16),
  Max Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-max-request-id format title="MOQT MAX_REQUEST_ID Message"}

* Max Request ID: The new Maximum Request ID for the session plus 1. If a
  Request ID equal to or larger than this is received by the endpoint that sent
  the MAX_REQUEST_ID in any request message (PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, FETCH,
  SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, SUBSCRIBE_UDPATE or TRACK_STATUS), the
  endpoint MUST close the session with an error of `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`.

MAX_REQUEST_ID is similar to MAX_STREAMS in ({{?RFC9000, Section 4.6}}), and
similar considerations apply when deciding how often to send MAX_REQUEST_ID.
For example, implementations might choose to increase MAX_REQUEST_ID as
subscriptions are closed to keep the number of available subscriptions roughly
consistent.

## REQUESTS_BLOCKED {#message-requests-blocked}

The REQUESTS_BLOCKED message is sent when an endpoint would like to send a new
request, but cannot because the Request ID would exceed the Maximum Request ID
value sent by the peer.  The endpoint SHOULD send only one REQUESTS_BLOCKED for
a given Maximum Request ID.

An endpoint MAY send a MAX_REQUEST_ID upon receipt of REQUESTS_BLOCKED, but it
MUST NOT rely on REQUESTS_BLOCKED to trigger sending a MAX_REQUEST_ID, because
sending REQUESTS_BLOCKED is not required.

~~~
REQUESTS_BLOCKED Message {
  Type (i) = 0x1A,
  Length (16),
  Maximum Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-requests-blocked format title="MOQT REQUESTS_BLOCKED Message"}

* Maximum Request ID: The Maximum Request ID for the session on which the
  endpoint is blocked. More on Request ID in {{request-id}}.

## REQUEST_ERROR {#message-request-error}

The REQUEST_ERROR message is sent to a response to any request (SUBSCRIBE, FETCH,
PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, TRACK_STATUS). The unique
request ID in the REQUEST_ERROR is used to associate it with the correct type of
request.

~~~
REQUEST_ERROR Message {
  Type (i) = 0x5,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-request-error format title="MOQT REQUEST_ERROR Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID to which this message is replying.

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for request failure.

* Error Reason: Provides a text description of the request error. See
 {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in REQUEST_ERROR,
as defined below. Most codepoints have identical meanings for various request
types, but some have request-specific meanings.

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x0):
: An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

UNAUTHORIZED (0x1):
: The subscriber is not authorized to perform the requested action on the given
track.

TIMEOUT (0x2):
: The subscription could not be completed before an implementation specific
  timeout. For example, a relay could not establish an upstream subscription
  within the timeout.

NOT_SUPPORTED (0x3):
: The endpoint does not support the type of request.

MALFORMED_AUTH_TOKEN (0x4):
: Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration (see
  {{authorization-token}}).

EXPIRED_AUTH_TOKEN (0x5):
: Authorization token has expired ({{authorization-token}}).

Below are errors for use by the publisher. They can appear in response to
SUBSCRIBE, FETCH, TRACK_STATUS, and SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, unless otherwise noted.

DOES_NOT_EXIST (0x10):
: The track or namespace is not available at the publisher.

INVALID_RANGE (0x11):
: In response to SUBSCRIBE or FETCH, specified Filter or range of Locations
cannot be satisfied.

MALFORMED_TRACK (0x12):
: In response to a FETCH, a relay publisher detected
the track was malformed (see {{malformed-tracks}}).

The following are errors for use by the subscriber. They can appear in response
to PUBLISH or PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, unless otherwise noted.

UNINTERESTED (0x20):
: The subscriber is not interested in the track or namespace.

Errors below can only be used in response to one message type.

PREFIX_OVERLAP (0x30):
: In response to SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, the namespace prefix overlaps with another
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE in the same session.

NO_OBJECTS (0x31):
: In response to FETCH, no objects exist between the Start and End Locations.

INVALID_JOINING_REQUEST_ID(0x32):
: In response to a Joining FETCH, the referenced Request ID is not an active
Subscription.

UNKNOWN_STATUS_IN_RANGE(0x33):
: In response to a FETCH, the requested range contains an object with unknown
status.

## SUBSCRIBE {#message-subscribe-req}

A subscription causes the publisher to send newly published objects for a track.
A subscriber MUST NOT make multiple active subscriptions for a track within a
single session and publishers SHOULD treat this as a protocol violation.

Subscribe only delivers newly published or received Objects.  Objects from the
past are retrieved using FETCH ({{message-fetch}}).

The format of SUBSCRIBE is as follows:

~~~
SUBSCRIBE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x3,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (..),
  Track Name Length (i),
  Track Name (..),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Group Order (8),
  Forward (8),
  Filter Type (i),
  [Start Location (Location),]
  [End Group (i),]
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined in
({{track-name}}).

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription relative to
other subscriptions in the same session. Lower numbers get higher priority.
See {{priorities}}.

* Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
A value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's Group Order SHOULD be
used. Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Forward: If 1, Objects matching the subscription are forwarded
to the subscriber. If 0, Objects are not forwarded to the subscriber.
Any other value is a protocol error and the subscriber MUST terminate the
session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` ({{session-termination}}).

Subscribing with Forward=0 allows publisher or relay to prepare to serve the
subscription in advance, reducing the time to receive objects in the future.

* Filter Type: Identifies the type of filter, which also indicates whether
the Start and End Group fields will be present.

* Start Location: The starting location for this subscriptions. Only present for
  "AbsoluteStart" and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

* End Group: The end Group ID. Only present for the "AbsoluteRange"
filter type.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

On successful subscription, the publisher MUST reply with a SUBSCRIBE_OK,
allowing the subscriber to determine the start group/object when not explicitly
specified and the publisher SHOULD start delivering objects.

If a publisher cannot satisfy the requested start or end or if the end has
already been published it SHOULD send a REQUEST_ERROR with code
`INVALID_RANGE`.  A publisher MUST NOT send objects from outside the requested
start and end.

## SUBSCRIBE_OK {#message-subscribe-ok}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_OK control message for successful
subscriptions.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x4,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Alias (i),
  Expires (i),
  Group Order (8),
  Content Exists (8),
  [Largest Location (Location),]
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-ok format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Track Alias: The identifer used for this track in Subgroups or Datagrams (see
  {{track-alias}}). The same Track Alias MUST NOT be used to refer to two
  different Tracks simultaneously. If a subscriber receives a SUBSCRIBE_OK that
  uses the same Track Alias as a different track with an active subscription, it
  MUST close the session with error `DUPLICATE_TRACK_ALIAS`.

* Expires: Time in milliseconds after which the subscription is no
longer valid. A value of 0 indicates that the subscription does not expire
or expires at an unknown time.  Expires is advisory and a subscription can
end prior to the expiry time or last longer.

* Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Content Exists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0 if not.
If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID fields will not be
present. Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` ({{session-termination}}).

* Largest Location: The location of the largest object available for this track. This
  field is only present if Content Exists has a value of 1.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE {#message-subscribe-update}

A subscriber sends a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE to a publisher to modify an existing
subscription. Subscriptions can only be narrowed, not widened, as an attempt to
widen could fail. If Objects with Locations smaller than the current
subscription's Start Location are required, FETCH can be used to retrieve
them. The Start Location MUST NOT decrease and the End Group MUST NOT increase.
A publisher MUST terminate the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` if the
SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE violates these rules or if the subscriber specifies a request
ID that has not existed within the Session.

When a subscriber narrows their subscription, it might still receive objects
outside the new range if the publisher sent them before the update was
processed.

There is no control message in response to a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE, because it is
expected that it will always succeed and the worst outcome is that it is not
processed promptly and some extra objects from the existing subscription are
delivered.

Like SUBSCRIBE, End Group MUST be greater than or equal to the Group specified
in `Start`.

If a parameter included in `SUBSCRIBE` is not present in
`SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE`, its value remains unchanged.  There is no mechanism to
remove a parameter from a subscription.

The format of SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE is as follows:

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x2,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Subscription Request ID (i),
  Start Location (Location),
  End Group (i),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Forward (8),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-update-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Subscription Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE
  ({{message-subscribe-req}}) this message is updating.  This MUST match an
  existing Request ID.

* Start Location : The starting location.

* End Group: The end Group ID, plus 1. A value of 0 means the subscription is
open-ended.

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription relative to
other subscriptions in the same session. Lower numbers get higher priority.
See {{priorities}}.

* Forward: If 1, Objects matching the subscription are forwarded
to the subscriber. If 0, Objects are not forwarded to the subscriber.
Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` ({{session-termination}}).

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## UNSUBSCRIBE {#message-unsubscribe}

A Subscriber issues an `UNSUBSCRIBE` message to a Publisher indicating it is no
longer interested in receiving the specified Track, indicating that the
Publisher stop sending Objects as soon as possible.

The format of `UNSUBSCRIBE` is as follows:

~~~
UNSUBSCRIBE Message {
  Type (i) = 0xA,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-unsubscribe-format title="MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the subscription that is being terminated. See
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

## PUBLISH {#message-publish}

The publisher sends the PUBLISH control message to initiate a subscription to a
track. The receiver verifies the publisher is authorized to publish this track.

~~~
PUBLISH Message {
  Type (i) = 0x1D,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (..),
  Track Name Length (i),
  Track Name (..),
  Track Alias (i),
  Group Order (8),
  Content Exists (8),
  [Largest Location (Location),]
  Forward (8),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-publish-format title="MOQT PUBLISH Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in ({{track-name}})

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Track Alias: The identifer used for this track in Subgroups or Datagrams (see
  {{track-alias}}). The same Track Alias MUST NOT be used to refer to two
  different Tracks simultaneously. If a subscriber receives a PUBLISH that
  uses the same Track Alias as a different track with an active subscription, it
  MUST close the session with error `DUPLICATE_TRACK_ALIAS`.

* Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
  Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
  Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Content Exists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0 if not.
  If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID fields will not be
  present. Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
  session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` ({{session-termination}}).

* Largest Location: The location of the largest object available for this track.

* Forward: The forward mode for this subscription.  Any value other than 0 or 1
  is a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.  0 indicates the publisher will not transmit any
  objects until the subscriber sets the Forward State to 1. 1 indicates the
  publisher will start transmitting objects immediately, even before PUBLISH_OK.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

A subscriber receiving a PUBLISH for a Track it does not wish to receive SHOULD
send REQUEST_ERROR with error code `UNINTERESTED`, and abandon reading any
publisher initiated streams associated with that subscription using a
STOP_SENDING frame.

## PUBLISH_OK {#message-publish-ok}

The subscriber sends a PUBLISH_OK control message to acknowledge the successful
authorization and acceptance of a PUBLISH message, and establish a subscription.

~~~
PUBLISH_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x1E,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Forward (8),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Group Order (8),
  Filter Type (i),
  [Start Location (Location),]
  [End Group (i),]
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-publish-ok format title="MOQT PUBLISH_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the PUBLISH this message is replying to
  {{message-publish}}.

* Forward: The Forward State for this subscription, either 0 (don't
  forward) or 1 (forward).

* Subscriber Priority: The Subscriber Priority for this subscription.

* Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
  Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
  Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error. This
  overwrites the GroupOrder specified in the corresponding PUBLISH message.

* Filter Type, Start Location, End Group: See {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Parameters: Parameters associated with this message.

## PUBLISH_DONE {#message-publish-done}

A publisher sends a `PUBLISH_DONE` message to indicate it is done publishing
Objects for that subscription.  The Status Code indicates why the subscription
ended, and whether it was an error. Because PUBLISH_DONE is sent on the control
stream, it is likely to arrive at the receiver before late-arriving objects, and
often even late-opening streams. However, the receiver uses it as an indication
that it should receive any late-opening streams in a relatively short time.

Note that some objects in the subscribed track might never be delivered,
because a stream was reset, or never opened in the first place, due to the
delivery timeout.

A sender MUST NOT send PUBLISH_DONE until it has closed all streams it will ever
open, and has no further datagrams to send, for a subscription. After sending
PUBLISH_DONE, the sender can immediately destroy subscription state, although
stream state can persist until delivery completes. The sender might persist
subscription state to enforce the delivery timeout by resetting streams on which
it has already sent FIN, only deleting it when all such streams have received
ACK of the FIN.

A sender MUST NOT destroy subscription state until it sends PUBLISH_DONE, though
it can choose to stop sending objects (and thus send PUBLISH_DONE) for any
reason.

A subscriber that receives PUBLISH_DONE SHOULD set a timer of at least its
delivery timeout in case some objects are still inbound due to prioritization or
packet loss. The subscriber MAY dispense with a timer if it sent UNSUBSCRIBE or
is otherwise no longer interested in objects from the track. Once the timer has
expired, the receiver destroys subscription state once all open streams for the
subscription have closed. A subscriber MAY discard subscription state earlier,
at the cost of potentially not delivering some late objects to the
application. The subscriber SHOULD send STOP_SENDING on all streams related to
the subscription when it deletes subscription state.

The format of `PUBLISH_DONE` is as follows:

~~~
PUBLISH_DONE Message {
  Type (i) = 0xB,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Status Code (i),
  Stream Count (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-fin-format title="MOQT PUBLISH_DONE Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the subscription that is being terminated. See
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Status Code: An integer status code indicating why the subscription ended.

* Stream Count: An integer indicating the number of data streams the publisher
opened for this subscription.  This helps the subscriber know if it has received
all of the data published in this subscription by comparing the number of
streams received.  The subscriber can immediately remove all subscription state
once the same number of streams have been processed.  If the track had
Forwarding Preference = Datagram, the publisher MUST set Stream Count to 0.  If
the publisher is unable to set Stream Count to the exact number of streams
opened for the subscription, it MUST set Stream Count to 2^62 - 1. Subscribers
SHOULD use a timeout or other mechanism to remove subscription state in case
the publisher set an incorrect value, reset a stream before the SUBGROUP_HEADER,
or set the maximum value.  If a subscriber receives more streams for a
subscription than specified in Stream Count, it MAY close the session with a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for subscription error. See {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant status code in PUBLISH_DONE, as defined
below:

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x0):
: An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

UNAUTHORIZED (0x1):
: The subscriber is no longer authorized to subscribe to the given track.

TRACK_ENDED (0x2):
: The track is no longer being published.

SUBSCRIPTION_ENDED (0x3):
: The publisher reached the end of an associated Subscribe filter.

GOING_AWAY (0x4):
: The subscriber or publisher issued a GOAWAY message.

EXPIRED (0x5):
: The publisher reached the timeout specified in SUBSCRIBE_OK.

TOO_FAR_BEHIND (0x6):
: The publisher's queue of objects to be sent to the given subscriber exceeds
  its implementation defined limit.

MALFORMED_TRACK (0x7):
: A relay publisher detected the track was malformed (see
  {{malformed-tracks}}).

## FETCH {#message-fetch}

A subscriber issues a FETCH to a publisher to request a range of already
published objects within a track.

There are three types of Fetch messages.

Code | Fetch Type
0x1 | Standalone Fetch
0x2 | Relative Joining Fetch
0x3 | Absolute Joining Fetch

An endpoint that receives a Fetch Type other than 0x1, 0x2 or 0x3 MUST close
the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

### Standalone Fetch

A Fetch of Objects performed independently of any Subscribe.

A Standalone Fetch includes this structure:

~~~
Standalone Fetch {
  Track Namespace (..),
  Track Name Length (i),
  Track Name (..),
  Start Location (Location),
  End Location (Location)
}
~~~

* Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined in
({{track-name}}).

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Start Location: The start Location.

* End Location: The end Location, plus 1. A Location.Object value of 0
  means the entire group is requested.

### Joining Fetches

A Joining Fetch is associated with a Subscribe request by
specifying the Request ID of an active subscription.
A publisher receiving a Joining Fetch uses properties of the associated
Subscribe to determine the Track Namespace, Track Name
and End Location such that it is contiguous with the associated
Subscribe.  The subscriber can set the Start Location to an absolute Location or
a Location relative to the current group.

A Subscriber can use a Joining Fetch to, for example, fill a playback buffer with a
certain number of groups prior to the live edge of a track.

A Joining Fetch is only permitted when the associated Subscribe has the Filter
Type Largest Object; any other value results in closing the session with a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

If no Objects have been published for the track, and the SUBSCRIBE_OK has a
Content Exists value of 0, the publisher MUST respond with a REQUEST_ERROR with
error code `INVALID_RANGE`.

A Joining Fetch includes this structure:

~~~
Joining Fetch {
  Joining Request ID (i),
  Joining Start (i)
}
~~~

* Joining Request ID: The Request ID of the existing subscription to be
  joined. If a publisher receives a Joining Fetch with a Request ID that does
  not correspond to an existing Subscribe in the same session, it MUST return
  a REQUEST_ERROR with error code `INVALID_JOINING_REQUEST_ID`

* Joining Start : A relative or absolute value used to determing the Start
  Location, described below.

#### Joining Fetch Range Calculation

The Largest Location value from the corresponding
subscription is used to calculate the end of a Joining Fetch so the
Objects retrieved by the FETCH and SUBSCRIBE are contiguous and non-overlapping.

The publisher receiving a Joining Fetch sets the End Location to {Subscribe
Largest Location.Object + 1}.

Note: the last Object included in the Joining FETCH response is Subscribe
Largest Location.  The `+ 1` above indicates the equivalent Standalone Fetch
encoding.

For a Relative Joining Fetch, the publisher sets the Start Location to
{Subscribe Largest Location.Group - Joining Start, 0}.

For an Absolute Joining Fetch, the publisher sets the Start Location to
{Joining Start, 0}.


### Fetch Handling

The format of FETCH is as follows:

~~~
FETCH Message {
  Type (i) = 0x16,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Group Order (8),
  Fetch Type (i),
  [Standalone (Standalone Fetch),]
  [Joining (Joining Fetch),]
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-format title="MOQT FETCH Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a fetch request relative to
  other subscriptions or fetches in the same session. Lower numbers get higher
  priority. See {{priorities}}.

* Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered in
  Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.  A
  value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's Group Order SHOULD be
  used. Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Fetch Type: Identifies the type of Fetch, whether Standalone, Relative
  Joining or Absolute Joining.

* Standalone: Standalone Fetch structure included when Fetch Type is 0x1

* Joining: Joining Fetch structure included when Fetch Type is 0x2 or 0x3.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

A publisher responds to a FETCH request with either a FETCH_OK or a REQUEST_ERROR
message.  The publisher creates a new unidirectional stream that is used to send the
Objects.  The FETCH_OK or REQUEST_ERROR can come at any time relative to object
delivery.

The publisher responding to a FETCH is
responsible for delivering all available Objects in the requested range in the
requested order. The Objects in the response are delivered on a single
unidirectional stream. Any gaps in the Group and Object IDs in the response
stream indicate objects that do not exist (eg: they implicitly have status
`Object Does Not Exist`).  For Ascending Group Order this includes ranges
between the first requested object and the first object in the stream; between
objects in the stream; and between the last object in the stream and the Largest
Group/Object indicated in FETCH_OK, so long as the fetch stream is terminated by
a FIN.  If no Objects exist in the requested range, the publisher returns
REQUEST_ERROR with code `NO_OBJECTS`.

A relay that has cached objects from the beginning of the range MAY start
sending objects immediately in response to a FETCH.  If it encounters an object
in the requested range that is not cached and has unknown status, the relay MUST
pause subsequent delivery until it has confirmed the object's status upstream.
If the upstream FETCH fails, the relay sends a REQUEST_ERROR and can reset the
unidirectional stream.  It can choose to do so immediately or wait until the
cached objects have been delivered before resetting the stream.

The Object Forwarding Preference does not apply to fetches.

Fetch specifies an inclusive range of Objects starting at Start Location and
ending at End Location. End Location MUST specify the same or a larger Location
than Start Location for Standalone and Absolute Joining Fetches.

Objects that are not yet published will not be retrieved by a FETCH.  The
Largest available Object in the requested range is indicated in the FETCH_OK,
and is the last Object a fetch will return if the End Location have not yet been
published.

If Start Location is greater than the `Largest Object`
({{message-subscribe-req}}) the publisher MUST return REQUEST_ERROR with error
code `INVALID_RANGE`.

A publisher MUST send fetched groups in the determined group order, either
ascending or descending. Within each group, objects are sent in ascending Object
ID order; subgroup ID is not used for ordering.

If an Original Publisher receives a FETCH with a range that includes an object with
unknown status, it MUST return REQUEST_ERROR with code UNKNOWN_STATUS_IN_RANGE.


## FETCH_OK {#message-fetch-ok}

A publisher sends a FETCH_OK control message in response to successful fetches.
A publisher MAY send Objects in response to a FETCH before the FETCH_OK message is sent,
but the FETCH_OK MUST NOT be sent until the End Location is known.

~~~
FETCH_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x18,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Group Order (8),
  End Of Track (8),
  End Location (Location),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-ok format title="MOQT FETCH_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the FETCH this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Group Order: Indicates the fetch will be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* End Of Track: 1 if all Objects have been published on this Track, and
  the End Location is the final Object in the Track, 0 if not.

* End Location: The largest object covered by the FETCH response.
  The End Location is determined as follows:
   - If the requested FETCH End Location was beyond the Largest known (possibly
     final) Object, End Location is {Largest.Group, Largest.Object + 1}
   - If End Location.Object in the FETCH request was 0 and the response covers
     the last Object in the Group, End Location is {Fetch.End Location.Group, 0}
   - Otherwise, End Location is Fetch.End Location
  Where Fetch.End Location is either Fetch.Standalone.End Location or the computed
  End Location described in {{joining-fetch-range-calculation}}.

  If the relay is subscribed to the track, it uses its knowledge of the largest
  {Group, Object} to set End Location.  If it is not subscribed and the
  requested End Location exceeds its cached data, the relay makes an upstream
  request to complete the FETCH, and uses the upstream response to set End
  Location.

  If End Location is smaller than the Start Location in the corresponding FETCH
  the receiver MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## FETCH_CANCEL {#message-fetch-cancel}

A subscriber sends a FETCH_CANCEL message to a publisher to indicate it is no
longer interested in receiving objects for the fetch identified by the 'Request
ID'. The publisher SHOULD promptly close the unidirectional stream, even if it
is in the middle of delivering an object.

The format of `FETCH_CANCEL` is as follows:

~~~
FETCH_CANCEL Message {
  Type (i) = 0x17,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-cancel title="MOQT FETCH_CANCEL Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the FETCH ({{message-fetch}}) this message is
  cancelling.

## TRACK_STATUS {#message-track-status}

A potential subscriber sends a `TRACK_STATUS` message on the control
stream to obtain information about the current status of a given track.

The TRACK_STATUS message format is identical to the SUBSCRIBE message
({{message-subscribe-req}}).

The receiver of a TRACK_STATUS message treats it identically as if it had
received a SUBSCRIBE message, except it does not create downstream subscription
state or send any Objects.  Relays without an active subscription MAY forward
TRACK_STATUS to one or more publishers, or MAY initiate a subscription (subject
to authorization) as described in {{publisher-interactions}} to determine the
response. The publisher does not send PUBLISH_DONE for this request, and the
subscriber cannot send SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE or UNSUBSCRIBE.

## TRACK_STATUS_OK {#message-track-status-ok}

The publisher sends a TRACK_STATUS_OK control message in response
to a successful TRACK_STATUS message.

The TRACK_STATUS_OK message format is identical to the SUBSCRIBE_OK message
({{message-subscribe-ok}}).

The publisher populates the fields of TRACK_STATUS_OK exactly as it would have
populated a SUBSCRIBE_OK, setting Track Alias to 0. It is not considered an error
if Track Alias 0 is already in use by an active subscription.

## PUBLISH_NAMESPACE {#message-pub-ns}

The publisher sends the PUBLISH_NAMESPACE control message to advertise that it
has tracks available within a Track Namespace. The receiver verifies the
publisher is authorized to publish tracks under this namespace.

~~~
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x6,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (..),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-pub-ns-format title="MOQT PUBLISH_NAMESPACE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
  {{track-name}}.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK {#message-pub-ns-ok}

The subscriber sends a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK control message to acknowledge the
successful authorization and acceptance of a PUBLISH_NAMESPACE message.

~~~
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x7,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-pub-ns-ok format title="MOQT PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the PUBLISH_NAMESPACE ({{message-pub-ns}}) this
  message is replying to.

## PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE {#message-pub-ns-done}

The publisher sends the `PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE` control message to indicate its
intent to stop serving new subscriptions for tracks within the provided Track
Namespace.

~~~
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x9,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace (..)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-pub-ns-done-format title="MOQT PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE Message"}

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
  {{track-name}}.

## PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL {#message-pub-ns-cancel}

The subscriber sends an `PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL` control message to
indicate it will stop sending new subscriptions for tracks
within the provided Track Namespace.

~~~
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL Message {
  Type (i) = 0xC,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace (..),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-pub-ns-cancel-format title="MOQT PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL Message"}

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
  {{track-name}}.

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for canceling the publish.
  PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_CANCEL uses the same error codes as REQUEST_ERROR
  ({{message-request-error}}) that responds to PUBLISH_NAMESPACE.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for publish cancelation. See
  {{reason-phrase}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE {#message-subscribe-ns}

The subscriber sends the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE control message to a publisher to
request the current set of matching published namespaces and established
subscriptions, as well as future updates to the set.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x11,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace Prefix (..),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-ns-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace Prefix: A Track Namespace structure as described in
  {{track-name}} with between 1 and 32 Track Namespace Fields.  This prefix is
  matched against track namespaces known to the publisher.  For example, if the
  publisher is a relay that has received PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages for
  namespaces ("example.com", "meeting=123", "participant=100") and
  ("example.com", "meeting=123", "participant=200"), a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE for
  ("example.com", "meeting=123") would match both.  If an endpoint receives a
  Track Namespace Prefix consisting of 0 or greater than than 32 Track Namespace
  Fields, it MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

The publisher will respond with SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or
REQUEST_ERROR.  If the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE is successful, the publisher will
immediately forward existing PUBLISH_NAMESPACE and PUBLISH messages that match
the Track Namespace Prefix that have not already been sent to this subscriber.
If the set of matching PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages changes, the publisher sends
the corresponding PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE message.

A subscriber cannot make overlapping namespace subscriptions on a single
session. Within a session, if a publisher receives a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE with a
Track Namespace Prefix that shares a common prefix with an active namespace
subscription, it MUST respond with REQUEST_ERROR with error code
`PREFIX_OVERLAP`.

The publisher MUST ensure the subscriber is authorized to perform this
namespace subscription.

SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE is not required for a publisher to send PUBLISH_NAMESPACE,
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE or PUBLISH messages to a subscriber.  It is useful in
applications or relays where subscribers are only interested in or authorized to
access a subset of available namespaces and tracks.

## SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK {#message-sub-ns-ok}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK control message for successful
namespace subscriptions.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x12,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-sub-ann-ok format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK
Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE
  ({{message-subscribe-ns}}) this message is replying to.


## UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE {#message-unsub-ns}

A subscriber issues a `UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE` message to a publisher indicating
it is no longer interested in PUBLISH_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE and
PUBLISH messages for the specified track namespace prefix.

The format of `UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE` is as follows:

~~~
UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x14,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace Prefix (..)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-unsub-ann-format title="MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message"}

* Track Namespace Prefix: As defined in {{message-subscribe-ns}}.


# Data Streams and Datagrams {#data-streams}

A publisher sends Objects matching a subscription on Data Streams or Datagrams
and sends Objects matching a FETCH request on one Data Stream.

All unidirectional MOQT streams start with a variable-length integer indicating
the type of the stream in question.

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ID          | Type                                            |
|------------:|:------------------------------------------------|
| 0x10-0x1D   | SUBGROUP_HEADER  ({{subgroup-header}})          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 0x05        | FETCH_HEADER  ({{fetch-header}})                |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|

All MOQT datagrams start with a variable-length integer indicating the type of
the datagram.

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ID                        | Type                                      |
|--------------------------:|:------------------------------------------|
| 0x00-0x07,0x20-21,0x24-25 | OBJECT_DATAGRAM ({{object-datagram}})     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

An endpoint that receives an unknown stream or datagram type MUST close the
session.

Every Track has a single 'Object Forwarding Preference' and the Original
Publisher MUST NOT mix different forwarding preferences within a single track
(see {{malformed-tracks}}).

## Track Alias

To optimize wire efficiency, Subgroups and Datagrams refer to a track by a
numeric identifier, rather than the Full Track Name.  Track Alias is chosen by
the publisher and included in SUBSCRIBE_OK ({{message-subscribe-ok}}) or PUBLISH
({{message-publish}}).

Objects can arrive after a subscription has been cancelled.  Subscribers SHOULD
retain sufficient state to quickly discard these unwanted Objects, rather than
treating them as belonging to an unknown Track Alias.


## Objects {#message-object}

An Object contains a range of contiguous bytes from the
specified track, as well as associated metadata required to deliver,
cache, and forward it.  Objects are sent by publishers.

### Canonical Object Properties {#object-properties}

A canonical MoQ Object has the following information:

* Track Namespace and Track Name: The track this object belongs to.

* Group ID: The identifier of the Object's Group (see {{model-group}}) within
  the Track.

* Object ID: The order of the object within the group.

* Publisher Priority: An 8 bit integer indicating the publisher's priority for
the Object ({{priorities}}).

* Object Forwarding Preference: An enumeration indicating how a publisher sends
an object. The preferences are Subgroup and Datagram.  Note that the Original
Publisher determines the Forwarding Preference for the entire Track, and is a
Track property that is implicitly signaled by the delivery of any Object using
either Subgroups or Datagrams. Once the property is established for one Object
of a Track, the same value MUST be used for all Objects of the Track.
In a subscription, an Object MUST be sent according to its `Object Forwarding
Preference`.

* Subgroup ID: The identifier of the Object's Subgroup (see {{model-subgroup}})
  within the Group. This field is omitted if the `Object Forwarding Preference`
  is Datagram.

* Object Status: An enumeration used to indicate missing
objects or mark the end of a group or track. See {{object-status}} below.

* Object Extension Length: The total length of the Object Extension Headers
  block, in bytes.

* Object Extensions : A sequence of Object Extension Headers. See
  {{object-extensions}} below.

* Object Payload: An opaque payload intended for an End Subscriber and SHOULD
NOT be processed by a relay. Only present when 'Object Status' is Normal (0x0).

#### Object Status {#object-status}

The Object Status informs subscribers what objects will not be received
because they were never produced, are no longer available, or because they
are beyond the end of a group or track.

`Status` can have following values:

* 0x0 := Normal object. This status is implicit for any non-zero length object.
         Zero-length objects explicitly encode the Normal status.

* 0x1 := Indicates Object Does Not Exist. Indicates that this Object does not
         exist at any publisher and it will not be published in the future. This
         SHOULD be cached.

* 0x3 := Indicates End of Group. Object ID is one greater than the largest
         Object produced in the Group identified by the Group ID. If the Object
         ID is 0, it indicates there are no Objects in this Group. This SHOULD
         be cached. A publisher MAY use an end of Group object to signal the end
         of all open Subgroups in a Group. A non-zero-length Object can be the
         End of Group, as signaled in the DATAGRAM or SUBGROUP_HEADER Type field
         (see {{object-datagram}} and {{subgroup-header}}).

* 0x4 := Indicates End of Track. Group ID is either the largest Group produced
         in this Track with Object ID one greater than the largest Object
         produced in that Group, or Group ID is one greater than the largest
         Group produced in this Track with Object ID zero. This status also
         indicates the specified Group has ended. Publishers MUST NOT publish an
         Object with a Location larger than this Location (see
         {{malformed-tracks}}). This SHOULD be cached.

Any other value SHOULD be treated as a protocol error and the session SHOULD
be terminated with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION` ({{session-termination}}).
Any object with a status code other than zero MUST have an empty payload.

#### Object Extension Header {#object-extensions}
Any Object may have extension headers except those with Object Status 'Object
Does Not Exist'.  If an endpoint receives a non-existent Object containing
extension headers it MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

Object Extension Headers are visible to relays and allow the transmission of
future metadata relevant to MOQT Object distribution. Any Object metadata never
intended to be accessed by the transport or Relays SHOULD be serialized as part
of the Object payload and not as an extension header.

Extension Headers are defined in external specifications and registered in an
IANA table {{iana}}. These specifications define the type and value of the
header, along with any rules concerning processing, modification, caching and
forwarding. A relay which is coded to implement these rules is said to
"support" the extension.

If unsupported by the relay, Extension Headers MUST NOT be modified, MUST be
cached as part of the Object and MUST be forwarded by relays.

If supported by the relay and subject to the processing rules specified in the
definition of the extension, Extension Headers MAY be modified, added, removed,
and/or cached by relays.

Object Extension Headers are serialized as Key-Value-Pairs (see
{{moq-key-value-pair}}), prefixed by the length of the serialized
Key-Value-Pairs, in bytes.

~~~
Extensions {
  Extension Headers Length (i),
  Extension headers (..),
}
~~~

Header types are registered in the IANA table 'MOQ Extension Headers'.
See {{iana}}.

## Datagrams

A single object can be conveyed in a datagram.  The Track Alias field
({{track-alias}}) indicates the track this Datagram belongs to.  If an endpoint
receives a datagram with an unknown Track Alias, it MAY drop the datagram or
choose to buffer it for a brief period to handle reordering with the control
message that establishes the Track Alias.

An Object received in an `OBJECT_DATAGRAM` message has an `Object Forwarding
Preference` = `Datagram`.

To send an Object with `Object Forwarding Preference` = `Datagram`, determine
the length of the header and payload and send the Object as datagram.  When the
total size is larger than the maximum datagram size for the session, the Object
will be dropped without any explicit notification.

Each session along the path between the Original Publisher and End Subscriber
might have different maximum datagram sizes. Additionally, Object Extension
Headers ({{object-extensions}}) can be added to Objects as they pass through
the MOQT network, increasing the size of the Object and the chances it will
exceed the maximum datagram size of a downstream session and be dropped.


### Object Datagram {#object-datagram}

An `OBJECT_DATAGRAM` carries a single object in a datagram.

~~~
OBJECT_DATAGRAM {
  Type (i) = 0x0-0x7,0x20-21,0x24-25
  Track Alias (i),
  Group ID (i),
  [Object ID (i),]
  [Publisher Priority (8),]
  [Extensions (..),]
  [Object Status (i),]
  [Object Payload (..),]
}
~~~
{: #object-datagram-format title="MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM"}

The Type value determines which fields are present in the OBJECT_DATAGRAM.
There are 10 defined Type values for OBJECT_DATAGRAM.

| Type | End Of Group | Extensions | Object ID | Priority Present | Status / Payload |
| 0x00 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Payload |
| 0x01 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Payload |
| 0x02 | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Payload |
| 0x03 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Payload |
| 0x04 | No | No | No | Yes | Payload |
| 0x05 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Payload |
| 0x06 | Yes | No | No | Yes | Payload |
| 0x07 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Payload |
| 0x20 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Status |
| 0x21 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Status |
| 0x24 | No | No | No | Yes | Status |
| 0x25 | No | Yes | No | Yes | Status |
| 0x08 | No | No | Yes | No | Payload |
| 0x09 | No | Yes | Yes | No | Payload |
| 0x0A | Yes | No | Yes | No | Payload |
| 0x0B | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Payload |
| 0x0C | No | No | No | No | Payload |
| 0x0D | No | Yes | No | No | Payload |
| 0x0E | Yes | No | No | No | Payload |
| 0x0F | Yes | Yes | No | No | Payload |
| 0x28 | No | No | Yes | No | Status |
| 0x29 | No | Yes | Yes | No | Status |
| 0x2C | No | No | Yes | No | Status |
| 0x2D | No | Yes | Yes | No | Status |

* End of Group: For Type values where End of Group is "Yes" the Object is the
  last Object in the Group.

* Extensions Present: If Extensions Present is "Yes" the Extensions structure
  defined in {{object-extensions}} is included. If an endpoint receives a
  datagram with Extensions Present as "Yes" and a Extension Headers Length of 0,
  it MUST close the session with a `PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

* Object ID Present: If Object ID Present is No, the Object ID field is omitted
  and the Object ID is 0.  When Object ID Present is Yes, the Object ID field is
  present and encodes the Object ID.

* Priority Present: If Priority Present is No, Priority is not present and this
  Object inherits the Publisher Priority specified in the control message that
  established the subscription.  When Priority Present is Yes, the Priority field
  is present.

* Payload and Status: The Object Status field and Object Payload are mutually
  exclusive.

  * For Type values 0x00 through 0x07, the Object Payload is present
    and the Object Status field is omitted.

    There is no explicit length field for the Object Payload. The entirety of the
    transport datagram following the Object header fields contains the payload.

  * For Type values 0x20, 0x21, 0x24 and 0x25 the Object Status field is present
    and there is no Object Payload.


## Streams

When Objects are sent on streams, the stream begins with a Subgroup or Fetch
Header and is followed by one or more sets of serialized Object fields.
If a stream ends gracefully (i.e., the stream terminates with a FIN) in the
middle of a serialized Object, the session SHOULD be terminated with a
`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`.

A publisher SHOULD NOT open more than one stream at a time with the same Subgroup
Header field values.

### Stream Cancellation

Streams aside from the control stream MAY be canceled due to congestion
or other reasons by either the publisher or subscriber. Early termination of a
stream does not affect the MoQ application state, and therefore has no
effect on outstanding subscriptions.

### Subgroup Header

All Objects on a Subgroup stream belong to the track identified by `Track Alias`
(see {{track-alias}}) and the Subgroup indicated by 'Group ID' and `Subgroup
ID` indicated by the SUBGROUP_HEADER.

If an endpoint receives a subgroup with an unknown Track Alias, it MAY abandon
the stream, or choose to buffer it for a brief period to handle reordering with
the control message that establishes the Track Alias.  The endpoint MAY withhold
stream flow control beyond the SUBGROUP_HEADER until the Track Alias has been
established.  To prevent deadlocks, the publisher MUST allocate connection flow
control to the control stream before allocating it any data streams. Otherwise,
a receiver might wait for a control message containing a Track Alias to release
flow control, while the sender waits for flow control to send the message.

~~~
SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type (i) = 0x10..0x1D,
  Track Alias (i),
  Group ID (i),
  [Subgroup ID (i),]
  [Publisher Priority (8),]
}
~~~
{: #object-header-format title="MOQT SUBGROUP_HEADER"}

All Objects received on a stream opened with `SUBGROUP_HEADER` have an
`Object Forwarding Preference` = `Subgroup`.

There are 24 defined Type values for SUBGROUP_HEADER:

|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|---------------|

For Type values where Contains End of Group is Yes, the last Object in this
Subgroup stream before a FIN is the last Object in the Group.  If the Subgroup
stream is terminated with a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT, the receiver cannot
determine the End of Group Object ID.

For Type values where Subgroup ID Field Present is No, there is no explicit
Subgroup ID field in the header and the Subgroup ID is either 0 (for Types
0x10-11 and 0x18-19) or the Object ID of the first object transmitted in this
subgroup (for Types 0x12-13 and 0x1A-1B).

For Type values where Extensions Present is No, the Extensions field is never
present and all Objects have no extensions.  When Extensions Present is Yes, the
Extensions structure defined in {{object-extensions}} is present in all Objects
in this subgroup.  Objects with no extensions set Extension Headers Length to 0.

For Type values where Priority Present is No, Priority is not present and this
Subgroup inherits the Publisher Priority specified in the control message that
established the subscription.  When Priority Present is Yes, the Priority field
is present in the Subgroup header.

To send an Object with `Object Forwarding Preference` = `Subgroup`, find the open
stream that is associated with the subscription, `Group ID` and `Subgroup ID`,
or open a new one and send the `SUBGROUP_HEADER`. Then serialize the
following fields.

The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is zero.

The Object ID Delta + 1 is added to the previous Object ID in the Subgroup
stream if there was one.  The Object ID is the Object ID Delta if it's the first
Object in the Subgroup stream. For example, a Subgroup of sequential Object IDs
starting at 0 will have 0 for all Object ID Delta values. A consumer cannot
infer information about the existence of Objects between the current and
previous Object ID in the Subgroup (e.g. when Object ID Delta is non-zero)
unless there is an Prior Object ID Gap extesnion header (see
{{prior-object-id-gap}}).

### Closing Subgroup Streams

Subscribers will often need to know if they have received all objects in a
Subgroup, particularly if they serve as a relay or cache. QUIC and Webtransport
streams provide signals that can be used for this purpose. Closing Subgroups
promptly frees system resources and often unlocks flow control credit to open
more streams.

If a sender has delivered all objects in a Subgroup to the QUIC stream, except
any Objects with Locations smaller than the subscription's Start Location, it
MUST close the stream with a FIN.

If a sender closes the stream before delivering all such objects to the QUIC
stream, it MUST use a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT
{{!I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset}} frame. This includes an open
Subgroup exceeding its Delivery Timeout, early termination of subscription due
to an UNSUBSCRIBE message, a publisher's decision to end the subscription early,
or a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE moving the subscription's End Group to a smaller Group or
the Start Location to a larger Location.  When RESET_STREAM_AT is used, the
reliable_size SHOULD include the stream header so the receiver can identify the
corresponding subscription and accurately account for reset data streams when
handling PUBLISH_DONE (see {{message-publish-done}}).  Publishers that reset
data streams without using RESET_STREAM_AT with an appropriate reliable_size can
cause subscribers to hold on to subscription state until a timeout expires.

A sender might send all objects in a Subgroup and the FIN on a QUIC stream,
and then reset the stream. In this case, the receiving application would receive
the FIN if and only if all objects were received. If the application receives
all data on the stream and the FIN, it can ignore any RESET_STREAM it receives.

If a sender will not deliver any objects from a Subgroup, it MAY send
a SUBGROUP_HEADER on a new stream, with no objects, and then send RESET_STREAM_AT
with a reliable_size equal to the length of the stream header. This explicitly
tells the receiver there is an unsent Subgroup.

A relay MUST NOT forward an Object on an existing Subgroup stream unless it is
the next Object in that Subgroup.  A relay determines that an Object is the next
Object in the Subgroup if at least one of the following is true:

 * The Object ID is one greater than the previous Object sent on this Subgroup
   stream.
 * The Object was received on the same upstream Subgroup stream as the
   previously sent Object on the downstream Subgroup stream, with no other
   Objects in between.
 * It determined all Object IDs between the current and previous Object IDs
   on the Subgroup stream belong to different Subgroups or do not exist.

If the relay does not know if an Object is the next Object, it MUST reset the
Subgroup stream and open a new one to forward it.

Since SUBSCRIBEs always end on a group boundary, an ending subscription can
always cleanly close all its subgroups. A sender that terminates a stream
early for any other reason (e.g., to handoff to a different sender) MUST
use RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT. Senders SHOULD terminate a stream on
Group boundaries to avoid doing so.

An MOQT implementation that processes a stream FIN is assured it has received
all objects in a subgroup from the start of the subscription. If a relay, it
can forward stream FINs to its own subscribers once those objects have been
sent. A relay MAY treat receipt of EndOfGroup or EndOfTrack objects as a signal
to close corresponding streams even if the FIN has not arrived, as further
objects on the stream would be a protocol violation.

Similarly, an EndOfGroup message indicates the maximum Object ID in the
Group, so if all Objects in the Group have been received, a FIN can be sent on
any stream where the entire subgroup has been sent. This might be complex to
implement.

Processing a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT means that there might be other
objects in the Subgroup beyond the last one received. A relay might immediately
reset the corresponding downstream stream, or it might attempt to recover the
missing Objects in an effort to send all the Objects in the subgroups and the FIN.
It also might send RESET_STREAM_AT with reliable_size set to the last Object it
has, so as to reliably deliver the Objects it has while signaling that other
Objects might exist.

A subscriber MAY send a QUIC STOP_SENDING frame for a subgroup stream if the Group
or Subgroup is no longer of interest to it. The publisher SHOULD respond with
RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT. If RESET_STREAM_AT is sent, note that the receiver
has indicated no interest in the objects, so setting a reliable_size beyond the
stream header is of questionable utility.

RESET_STREAM and STOP_SENDING on SUBSCRIBE data streams have no impact on other
Subgroups in the Group or the subscription, although applications might cancel all
Subgroups in a Group at once.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in RESET_STREAM or
RESET_STREAM_AT, as defined below:

INTERNAL_ERROR (0x0):
: An implementation specific error.

CANCELLED (0x1):
: The subscriber requested cancellation via UNSUBSCRIBE, FETCH_CANCEL or
  STOP_SENDING, or the publisher ended the subscription, in which case
  PUBLISH_DONE ({{message-publish-done}}) will have a more detailed status
  code.

DELIVERY_TIMEOUT (0x2):
: The DELIVERY TIMEOUT {{delivery-timeout}} was exceeded for this stream.

SESSION_CLOSED (0x3):
: The publisher session is being closed.

### Fetch Header {#fetch-header}

When a stream begins with `FETCH_HEADER`, all objects on the stream belong to the
track requested in the Fetch message identified by `Request ID`.

~~~
FETCH_HEADER {
  Type (i) = 0x5,
  Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fetch-header-format title="MOQT FETCH_HEADER"}


Each object sent on a fetch stream after the FETCH_HEADER has the following format:

~~~
{
  Group ID (i),
  Subgroup ID (i),
  Object ID (i),
  Publisher Priority (8),
  Extensions (..),
  Object Payload Length (i),
  [Object Status (i),]
  [Object Payload (..),]
}
~~~
{: #object-fetch-format title="MOQT Fetch Object Fields"}

The Extensions structure is defined in {{object-extensions}}.

The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is zero.

The Subgroup ID field of an object with a Forwarding Preference of "Datagram"
(see {{object-properties}}) is set to the Object ID.

## Examples

Sending a subgroup on one stream:

~~~
Stream = 2

SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type = 0x14
  Track Alias = 2
  Group ID = 0
  Subgroup ID = 0
  Priority = 0
}
{
  Object ID = 0
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "abcd"
}
{
  Object ID = 1
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "efgh"
}
~~~

Sending a group on one stream, with the first object containing two
Extension Headers.

~~~
Stream = 2

SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type = 0x35
  Track Alias = 2
  Group ID = 0
  Subgroup ID = 0
}
{
  Object ID Delta = 0 (Object ID is 0)
  Extension Headers Length = 33
    { Type = 4
      Value = 2186796243
    },
    { Type = 77
      Length = 21
      Value = "traceID:123456"
    }
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "abcd"
}
{
  Object ID Delta = 0 (Object ID is 1)
  Extension Headers Length = 0
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "efgh"
}

~~~

# Extension Headers

The following Object Extension Headers are defined in MOQT.

## Prior Group ID Gap

Prior Group ID Gap (Extension Header Type 0x3C) is a variable length integer
containing the number of Groups prior to the current Group that do not and will
never exist. This is equivalent to receiving an `End of Group` status with
Object ID 0 for each skipped Group. For example, if the Original Publisher is
publishing an Object in Group 7 and knows it will never publish any Objects in
Group 8 or Group 9, it can include Prior Group ID Gap = 2 in any number of
Objects in Group 10, as it sees fit.  A Track is considered malformed (see
{{malformed-tracks}}) if any of the following conditions are detected:

 * An Object contains more than one instance of Prior Group ID Gap.
 * A Group contains more than one Object with different values for Prior Group
    ID Gap.
 * An Object has a Prior Group ID Gap larger than the Group ID.
 * An endpoint receives an Object with a Prior Group ID Gap covering an Object
   it previously received.
 * An endpoint receives an Object with a Group ID within a previously
   communicated gap.

This extension is optional, as publishers might not know the prior gap gize, or
there may not be a gap. If Prior Group ID Gap is not present, the receiver
cannot infer any information about the existence of prior groups (see
{{group-ids}}).

This extension can be added by the Original Publisher, but MUST NOT be added by
relays. This extension MUST NOT be modified or removed.

## Immutable Extensions

The Immutable Extensions (Extension Header Type 0xB) contains a sequence of
Key-Value-Pairs (see {{moq-key-value-pair}}) which are also Object Extension
Headers of the Object.

~~~
Immutable Extensions {
  Type (0xB),
  Length (i),
  Key-Value-Pair (..) ...
}
~~~

This extension can be added by the Original Publisher, but MUST NOT be added by
Relays. This extension MUST NOT be modified or removed. Relays MUST cache this
extension if the Object is cached and MUST forward this extension if the
enclosing Object is forwarded. Relays MAY decode and view these extensions.

A Track is considered malformed (see {{malformed-tracks}}) if any of the
following conditions are detected:

 * An Object contains an Immutable Extensions header that contains another
   Immutable Extensions key.
 * A Key-Value-Pair cannot be parsed.

The following figure shows an example Object structure with a combination of
mutable and immutable extensions and end to end encrypted metadata in the Object
payload.

~~~
                   Object Header                      Object Payload
<------------------------------------------------> <------------------->
+--------+-------+------------+-------+-----------+--------------------+
| Object | Ext 1 | Immutable  | Ext N | [Payload] | Private Extensions |
| Fields |       | Extensions |       | [Length]  | App Payload        |
+--------+-------+------------+-------+-----------+--------------------+
                  xxxxxxxxxxxx                     xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                                                   yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
x = e2e Authenticated Data
y = e2e Encrypted Data
EXT 1 and EXT N can be modified or removed by Relays
~~~

## Prior Object ID Gap

Prior Object ID Gap (Extension Header Type 0x3E) is a variable length integer
containing the number of Objects prior to the current Object that do not and
will never exist. This is equivalent to receiving an `Object Does Not Exist`
status for each skipped Object ID. For example, if the Original Publisher is
publishing Object 10 in Group 3 and knows it will never publish Objects 8 or 9
in this Group, it can include Prior Object ID Gap = 2.  A Track is considered
malformed (see {{malformed-tracks}}) if any of the following conditions are
detected:

 * An Object contains more than one instance of Prior Object ID Gap.
 * An Object has a Prior Object ID Gap larger than the Object ID.
 * An endpoint receives an Object with a Prior Object ID Gap covering an Object
   it previously received.
 * An endpoint receives an Object with an Object ID within a previously
   communicated gap.

This extension is optional, as publishers might not know the prior gap gize, or
there may not be a gap. If Prior Object ID Gap is not present, the receiver
cannot infer any information about the existence of prior objects (see
{{model-object}}).

This extension can be added by the Original Publisher, but MUST NOT be added by
relays. This extension MUST NOT be modified or removed.

# Security Considerations {#security}

TODO: Expand this section, including subscriptions.

TODO: Describe Cache Poisoning attacks

## Resource Exhaustion

Live content requires significant bandwidth and resources.  Failure to
set limits will quickly cause resource exhaustion.

MOQT uses stream limits and flow control to impose resource limits at
the network layer.  Endpoints SHOULD set flow control limits based on the
anticipated bitrate.

Endpoints MAY impose a MAX STREAM count limit which would restrict the
number of concurrent streams which an application could have in
flight.

The publisher prioritizes and transmits streams out of order.  Streams
might be starved indefinitely during congestion.  The publisher and
subscriber MUST cancel a stream, preferably the one with the lowest
priority, after reaching a resource limit.


## Timeouts

Implementations are advised to use timeouts to prevent resource
exhaustion attacks by a peer that does not send expected data within
an expected time.  Each implementation is expected to set its own timeouts.

## Relay security considerations

### State maintenance

A Relay SHOULD have mechanisms to prevent malicious endpoints from flooding it
with PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE requests that could bloat data
structures. It could use the advertised MAX_REQUEST_ID to limit the number of
such requests, or could have application-specific policies that can reject
incoming PUBLISH_NAMESPACE or SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE requests that cause the state
maintenance for the session to be excessive.

### SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE with short prefixes

A Relay can use authorization rules in order to prevent subscriptions closer
to the root of a large prefix tree. Otherwise, if an entity sends a relay a
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE message with a short prefix, it can cause the relay to send
a large volume of PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages. As churn continues in the tree of
prefixes, the relay would have to continue to send
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE/PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE messages to the entity that had sent
the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

TODO: fill out currently missing registries:

* MOQT version numbers
* Setup parameters
* Non-setup Parameters - List which params can be repeated in the table.
* Message types
* MOQ Extension headers - we wish to reserve extension types 0-63 for
  standards utilization where space is a premium, 64 - 16383 for
  standards utilization where space is less of a concern, and 16384 and
  above for first-come-first-served non-standardization usage.
  List which headers can be repeated in the table.
* MOQT Auth Token Type

The original design behind this protocol was inspired by three independent
proposals: WARP {{?I-D.draft-lcurley-warp}} by Luke Curley, RUSH
{{?I-D.draft-kpugin-rush}} by Kirill Pugin, Nitin Garg, Alan Frindell, Jordi
Cenzano and Jake Weissman, and QUICR {{?I-D.draft-jennings-moq-quicr-proto}} by
Cullen Jennings, Suhas Nandakumar and Christian Huitema.  The authors of those
documents merged their proposals to create the first draft of moq-transport.
The IETF MoQ Working Group received an enormous amount of support from many
people. The following people provided substantive contributions to this

  Phrase
* Limit lengths of all variable length fields, including Track Namespace and Name
* Control Message length is now 16 bits instead of variable length
* Subscribe ID became Request ID, and was added to most control messages. Request ID
  is used to correlate OK/ERROR responses for ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE,

* Objects that Do Not Exist cannot have extensions when sent on the wire
* Specified error codes for resetting data streams
* Defined an Object Header Extension for communicating a known Group ID gap
* Replaced AUTHORIZATION_INFO with AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN, which has more structure,
  compression, and additional Auth related error codes (#760)
