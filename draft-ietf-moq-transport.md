--- abstract

This document defines the core behavior for Media over QUIC Transport
(MOQT), a media transport protocol designed to operate over QUIC and
WebTransport, which have similar functionality. MOQT allows a producer of
media to publish data and have it consumed via subscription by a
multiplicity of endpoints. It supports intermediate content distribution
networks and is designed for high scale and low latency distribution.

# Introduction

Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) is a protocol that is optimized
for the QUIC protocol {{QUIC}}, either directly or via WebTransport
{{WebTransport}}, for the dissemination of media. MOQT utilizes a
publish/subscribe workflow in which producers of media publish data in
response to subscription requests from a multiplicity of endpoints. MOQT
supports wide range of use-cases with different resiliency and latency
(live, interactive) needs without compromising the scalability and cost
effectiveness associated with content delivery networks.

MOQT is a generic protocol designed to work in concert with multiple
MoQ Streaming Formats. These MoQ Streaming Formats define how content is
encoded, packaged, and mapped to MOQT objects, along with policies for
discovery and subscription.

* {{model}} describes the data model employed by MOQT.

* {{session}} covers aspects of setting up an MOQT session.

* {{priorities}} covers mechanisms for prioritizing subscriptions.

* {{relays-moq}} covers behavior at the relay entities.

* {{message}} covers how control messages are encoded on the wire.

* {{data-streams}} covers how data messages are encoded on the wire.


## Motivation

The development of MOQT is driven by goals in a number of areas -
specifically latency, the robust feature set of QUIC and relay
support.

### Latency

Latency is necessary to correct for variable network throughput. Ideally live
content is consumed at the same bitrate it is produced. End-to-end latency would
be fixed and only subject to encoding and transmission delays. Unfortunately,
networks have variable throughput, primarily due to congestion. Attempting to
deliver content encoded at a higher bitrate than the network can cause
queuing along the path from producer to consumer. The speed at which a protocol
can detect and respond to congestion determines the overall latency. TCP-based
protocols are simple but are slow to detect congestion and suffer from
head-of-line blocking. Protocols utilizing UDP directly can avoid queuing, but
the application is then responsible for the complexity of fragmentation,
congestion control, retransmissions, receiver feedback, reassembly, and
more. One goal of MOQT is to achieve the best of both these worlds: leverage the
features of QUIC to create a simple yet flexible low latency protocol that can
rapidly detect and respond to congestion.

### Leveraging QUIC

The parallel nature of QUIC streams can provide improvements in the face
of loss. A goal of MOQT is to design a streaming protocol to leverage
the transmission benefits afforded by parallel QUIC streams as well
exercising options for flexible loss recovery.

### Convergence

Some live media architectures today have separate protocols for ingest and
distribution, for example RTMP and HTTP based HLS or DASH. Switching protocols
necessitates intermediary origins which re-package the
media content. While specialization can have its benefits, there are efficiency
gains to be had in not having to re-package content. A goal of MOQT is to
develop a single protocol which can be used for transmission from contribution
to distribution. A related goal is the ability to support existing encoding and
packaging schemas, both for backwards compatibility and for interoperability
with the established content preparation ecosystem.

### Relays

An integral feature of a protocol being successful is its ability to
deliver media at scale. Greatest scale is achieved when third-party
networks, independent of both the publisher and subscriber, can be
leveraged to relay the content. These relays must cache content for
distribution efficiency while simultaneously routing content and
deterministically responding to congestion in a multi-tenant network. A
goal of MOQT is to treat relays as first-class citizens of the protocol
and ensure that objects are structured such that information necessary
for distribution is available to relays while the media content itself
remains opaque and private.

## Notational Conventions

This document uses the conventions detailed in ({{?RFC9000, Section 1.3}})
when describing the binary encoding.

As a quick reference, the following list provides a non normative summary
of the parts of RFC9000 field syntax that are used in this specification.

x (L):

: Indicates that x is L bits long

x (i):

: Indicates that x holds an integer value using the variable-length
  encoding as described in ({{?RFC9000, Section 16}})

x (..):

: Indicates that x can be any length including zero bits long.  Values
 in this format always end on a byte boundary.

[x (L)]:

: Indicates that x is optional and has a length of L

x (L) ...:

: Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times and that each instance
  has a length of L

This document extends the RFC9000 syntax and with the additional field types:

x (b):

: Indicates that x consists of a variable length integer encoding as
  described in ({{?RFC9000, Section 16}}), followed by that many bytes
  of binary data

x (tuple):

: Indicates that x is a tuple, consisting of a variable length integer encoded
  as described in ({{?RFC9000, Section 16}}), followed by that many variable
  length tuple fields, each of which are encoded as (b) above.

To reduce unnecessary use of bandwidth, variable length integers SHOULD
be encoded using the least number of bytes possible to represent the
required value.

### Location Structure

Location identifies a particular Object in a Group within a Track.

~~~
Location {
  Group (i),
  Object (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-location format title="Location structure"}

In this document, the constituent parts of any Location A can be referred to
using A.Group or A.Object.

Location A < Location B if:

`A.Group < B.Group || (A.Group == B.Group && A.Object < B.Object)`

### Key-Value-Pair Structure

Key-Value-Pair is a flexible structure designed to carry key/value
pairs in which the key is a variable length integer and the value
is either a variable length integer or a byte field of arbitrary
length.

Key-Value-Pair is used in both the data plane and control plane, but
is optimized for use in the data plane.

~~~
Key-Value-Pair {
  Type (i),
  [Length (i),]
  Value (..)
}
~~~
{: #moq-key-value-pair format title="MOQT Key-Value-Pair"}

* Type: an unsigned integer, encoded as a varint, identifying the
  type of the value and also the subsequent serialization.
* Length: Only present when Type is odd. Specifies the length of the Value field.
  The maximum length of a value is 2^16-1 bytes.  If an endpoint receives a
  length larger than the maximum, it MUST close the session with a Protocol
  Violation.
* Value: A single varint encoded value when Type is even, otherwise a
  sequence of Length bytes.

If a receiver understands a Type, and the following Value or
Length/Value does not match the serialization defined by that Type,
the receiver MUST terminate the session with error code 'Key-Value
Formatting Error'.

### Reason Phrase Structure {#reason-phrase}

Reason Phrase provides a way for the sender to encode additional diagnostic
information about the error condition, where appropriate.

~~~
Reason Phrase {
  Reason Phrase Length (i),
  Reason Phrase Value (..)
}
~~~

* Reason Phrase Length: A variable-length integer specifying the length of the
  reason phrase in bytes. The reason phrase length has a maximum length of
  1024 bytes. If an endpoint receives a length exceeding the maximum, it MUST
  close the session with a Protocol Violation

* Reason Phrase Value: Additional diagnostic information about the error condition.
  The reason phrase value is encoded as UTF-8 string and does not carry information,
  such as language tags, that would aid comprehension by any entity other than
  the one that created the text.

# Object Data Model {#model}

MOQT has a hierarchical data model, comprised of tracks which contain
groups, and groups that contain objects. Inside of a group, the objects
can be organized into subgroups.

To give an example of how an application might use this data model,
consider an application sending high and low resolution video using a
codec with temporal scalability. Each resolution is sent as a separate
track to allow the subscriber to pick the appropriate resolution given
the display environment and available bandwidth. Each "group of pictures"
in a video is sent as a group because the first frame is needed to
decode later frames. This allows the client to join at the logical points
where they can get the information to start decoding the media.
The temporal layers are sent as separate sub groups to allow the
priority mechanism to favour the base layer when there is not enough
bandwidth to send both the base and enhancement layers. Each frame of
video on a given layer is sent as a single object.

## Objects {#model-object}

The basic data element of MOQT is an object.  An object is an
addressable unit whose payload is a sequence of bytes.  All objects
belong to a group, indicating ordering and potential
dependencies (see {{model-group}}).  An object is uniquely identified by
its track namespace, track name, group ID, and object ID, and must be an
identical sequence of bytes regardless of how or where it is retrieved.
An Object can become unavailable, but its contents MUST NOT change over
time.

Objects are comprised of two parts: metadata and a payload.  The metadata is
never encrypted and is always visible to relays (see {{relays-moq}}). The
payload portion may be encrypted, in which case it is only visible to the
Original Publisher and End Subscribers. The Original Publisher is solely
responsible for the content of the object payload. This includes the
underlying encoding, compression, any end-to-end encryption, or
authentication. A relay MUST NOT combine, split, or otherwise modify object
payloads.

Objects within a Group are ordered numerically by their Object ID.

## Subgroups {#model-subgroup}

A subgroup is a sequence of one or more objects from the same group
({{model-group}}) in ascending order by Object ID. Objects in a subgroup
have a dependency and priority relationship consistent with sharing a
stream and are sent on a single stream whenever possible. A Group is delivered
using at least as many streams as there are Subgroups,
typically with a one-to-one mapping between Subgroups and streams.

When a Track's forwarding preference (see {{object-properties}}) is
"Datagram", Objects are not sent in Subgroups and the
description in the remainder of this section does not apply.

Streams offer in-order reliable delivery and the ability to cancel sending
and retransmission of data. Furthermore, many implementations offer the ability
to control the relative priority of streams, which allows control over the
scheduling of sending data on active streams.

Every object within a Group belongs to exactly one Subgroup.

Objects from two subgroups cannot be sent on the same stream. Objects from the
same Subgroup MUST NOT be sent on different streams, unless one of the streams
was reset prematurely, or upstream conditions have forced objects from a Subgroup
to be sent out of Object ID order.

Original publishers assign each Subgroup a Subgroup ID, and do so as they see fit.  The
scope of a Subgroup ID is a Group, so Subgroups from different Groups MAY share a Subgroup
ID without implying any relationship between them. In general, publishers assign
objects to subgroups in order to leverage the features of streams as described
above.

An example strategy for using stream properties follows. If object B is
dependent on object A, then delivery of B can follow A, i.e. A and B can be
usefully delivered over a single stream. Furthermore, in this example:

- If an object is dependent on all previous objects in a Subgroup, it is added to
that Subgroup.

- If an object is not dependent on all of the objects in a Subgroup, it goes in
a different Subgroup.

- There are often many ways to compose Subgroups that meet these criteria. Where
possible, choose the composition that results in the fewest Subgroups in a group
to minimize the number of streams used.


## Groups {#model-group}

A group is a collection of Objects and is a sub-unit of a Track
({{model-track}}).  Groups SHOULD be independently useful, so Objects within a
Group SHOULD NOT depend on Objects in other Groups. A Group provides a join
point for subscriptions, so a subscriber that does not want to receive the
entire Track can opt to receive only Groups starting from a given Group ID.
Groups can contain any number of Objects.

### Group Ordering

Within a track, the original publisher SHOULD publish Group IDs which increase
with time (where "time" is defined according to the internal clock of the media
being sent). In some cases, Groups will be produced in increasing order, but sent
to subscribers in a different order, for example when the subscription's Group
Order is Descending.  Due to network reordering and the partial reliability
features of MOQT, Groups can always be received out of order.

As a result, subscribers cannot infer the existence of a Group until an object in
the Group is received. This can create gaps in a cache that can be filled
by doing a Fetch upstream, if necessary.

Applications that cannot produce Group IDs that increase with time are limited
to the subset of MOQT that does not compare group IDs. Subscribers to these
Tracks SHOULD NOT use range filters which span multiple Groups in FETCH or
SUBSCRIBE.  SUBSCRIBE and FETCH delivery use Group Order, so a FETCH cannot
deliver Groups out of order and a subscription could have unexpected delivery
order if Group IDs do not increase with time.

Note that the increase in time between two groups is not defined by the protocol.

## Track {#model-track}

A track is a sequence of groups ({{model-group}}). It is the entity
against which a subscriber issues a subscription request.  A subscriber
can request to receive individual tracks starting at a group boundary,
including any new objects pushed by the publisher while the track is
active.

### Track Naming {#track-name}

In MOQT, every track is identified by a Full Track Name, consisting of a Track
Namespace and a Track Name.

Track Namespace is an ordered N-tuple of bytes where N can be between 1 and 32.
The structured nature of Track Namespace allows relays and applications to
manipulate prefixes of a namespace. If an endpoint receives a Track Namespace
tuple with an N of 0 or more than 32, it MUST close the session with a Protocol
Violation.

Track Name is a sequence of bytes that identifies an individual track within the
namespace.

The maximum total length of a Full Track Name is 4,096 bytes, computed as the
sum of the lengths of each Track Namespace tuple field and the Track Name length
field.  If an endpoint receives a Full Track Name exceeding this length, it MUST
close the session with a Protocol Violation.

In this specification, both the Track Namespace tuple fields and the Track Name
are not constrained to a specific encoding. They carry a sequence of bytes and
comparison between two Track Namespace tuple fields or Track Names is done by
exact comparison of the bytes. Specifications that use MOQT may constrain the
information in these fields, for example by restricting them to UTF-8. Any
specification that does needs to specify the canonicalization into the bytes in
the Track Namespace or Track Name such that exact comparison works.

## Malformed Tracks

There are multiple ways a publisher can transmit a Track that does not conform
to MoQT constraints. Such a Track is considered malformed.  Some example
conditions that constitute a malformed track when detected by a receiver
include:

1. An Object is received on a Subgroup stream whose Object ID is not strictly
   larger than the previous Object received on the same Subgroup.
2. An Object is received in a FETCH response with the same Group as the
   previous Object, but whose Object ID is not strictly larger than the previous
   object.
3. An Object is received in an Ascending FETCH response whose Group ID is smaller
   than the previous Object in the response.
4. An Object is received in a Descending FETCH response whose Group ID is larger
   than the previous Object in the resopnse.
5. A Subgroup or FETCH response is terminated with a FIN in the middle of an
   Object
6. An Object is received whose Object ID is larger than the final Object in the
   Subgroup.  The final Object in a Subgroup is the last Object received on a
   Subgroup stream before a FIN.
7. A Subgroup is received with two or more different final Objects.
8. An Object is received in a Group whose Object ID is larger than the final
   Object in the Group.  The final Object in a Group is the Object with Status
   END_OF_GROUP or the last Object sent in a FETCH that requested the entire
   Group.
9. An Object is received on a Track whose Group and Object ID are larger than the
   final Object in the Track.  The final Object in a Track is the Object with
   Status END_OF_TRACK or the last Object sent in a FETCH whose response indicated
   End of Track.
10. The same Object is received more than once with different Payload or
    other immutable properties.
11. An Object is received with a different Forwarding Preference than previously
    observed from the same Track.

The above list of conditions is not considered exhaustive.

When a subscriber detects a Malformed Track, it MUST UNSUBSCRIBE from the
Track and SHOULD deliver an error to the application.  If a relay detects a
Malformed Track, it MUST immediately terminate downstream subscriptions with
SUBSCRIBE_DONE with Status Code `Malformed Track`.


### Scope {#track-scope}

An MOQT scope is a set of servers (as identified by their connection
URIs) for which the tuple of Track Name and Track Namespace are
guaranteed to be unique and identify a specific track. It is up to
the application using MOQT to define how broad or narrow the scope is.
An application that deals with connections between devices
on a local network may limit the scope to a single connection; by
contrast, an application that uses multiple CDNs to serve media may
require the scope to include all of those CDNs.

Because the tuple of Track Namespace and Track Name are unique within an
MOQT scope, they can be used as a cache key for the track.
If, at a given moment in time, two tracks within the same scope contain
different data, they MUST have different names and/or namespaces.
MOQT provides subscribers with the ability to alter the specific manner in
which tracks are delivered via Subscribe Parameters, but the actual content of
the tracks does not depend on those parameters; this is in contrast to
protocols like HTTP, where request headers can alter the server response.

# Sessions {#session}

## Session establishment {#session-establishment}

This document defines a protocol that can be used interchangeably both
over a QUIC connection directly [QUIC], and over WebTransport
[WebTransport].  Both provide streams and datagrams with similar
semantics (see {{?I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview, Section 4}}); thus, the
main difference lies in how the servers are identified and how the
connection is established. The [QUIC-DATAGRAM] extension
MUST be supported and negotiated in the QUIC connection used for MOQT,
which is already a requirement for WebTransport over HTTP/3. The
RESET_STREAM_AT {{!I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset}}
extension to QUIC can be used by MOQT, but the protocol is also
designed to work correctly when the extension is not supported.

There is no definition of the protocol over other transports,
such as TCP, and applications using MoQ might need to fallback to
another protocol when QUIC or WebTransport aren't available.

### WebTransport

An MOQT server that is accessible via WebTransport can be identified
using an HTTPS URI ({{!RFC9110, Section 4.2.2}}).  An MOQT session can be
established by sending an extended CONNECT request to the host and the
path indicated by the URI, as described in
({{WebTransport, Section 3}}).

### QUIC

An MOQT server that is accessible via native QUIC can be identified by a
URI with a "moqt" scheme.  The "moqt" URI scheme is defined as follows,
using definitions from {{!RFC3986}}:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
moqt-URI = "moqt" "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `authority` portion MUST NOT contain an empty `host` portion.
The `moqt` URI scheme supports the `/.well-known/` path prefix defined in
{{!RFC8615}}.

This protocol does not specify any semantics on the `path-abempty` and
`query` portions of the URI.  The contents of those are left up to the
application.

The client can establish a connection to a MoQ server identified by a
given URI by setting up a QUIC connection to the host and port
identified by the `authority` section of the URI.  The `path-abempty`
and `query` portions of the URI are communicated to the server using the
PATH parameter ({{path}}) which is sent in the CLIENT_SETUP message at the
start of the session.  The ALPN value {{!RFC7301}} used by the protocol
is `moq-00`.

### Connection URL

Each track MAY have one or more associated connection URLs specifying
network hosts through which a track may be accessed. The syntax of the
Connection URL and the associated connection setup procedures are
specific to the underlying transport protocol usage (see {{session}}).

## Version and Extension Negotiation {#version-negotiation}

Endpoints use the exchange of Setup messages to negotiate the MOQT version and
any extensions to use.

The client indicates the MOQT versions it supports in the CLIENT_SETUP message
(see {{message-setup}}). It also includes the union of all Setup Parameters
(see {{setup-params}}) required for a handshake by any of those versions.

Within any MOQT version, clients request the use of extensions by adding Setup
parameters corresponding to that extension. No extensions are defined in this
document.

The server replies with a SERVER_SETUP message that indicates the chosen
version, includes all parameters required for a handshake in that version, and
parameters for every extension requested by the client that it supports.

New versions of MOQT MUST specify which existing extensions can be used with
that version. New extensions MUST specify the existing versions with which they
can be used.

If a given parameter carries the same information in multiple versions,
but might have different optimal values in those versions, there SHOULD be
separate Setup parameters for that information in each version.

## Session initialization {#session-init}

The first stream opened is a client-initiated bidirectional control stream where
the endpoints exchange Setup messages ({{message-setup}}), followed by other
messages defined in {{message}}.

This draft only specifies a single use of bidirectional streams. Objects are
sent on unidirectional streams.  Because there are no other uses of
bidirectional streams, a peer MAY currently close the session as a
'Protocol Violation' if it receives a second bidirectional stream.

The control stream MUST NOT be closed at the underlying transport layer while the
session is active.  Doing so results in the session being closed as a
'Protocol Violation'.

## Termination  {#session-termination}

The Transport Session can be terminated at any point.  When native QUIC
is used, the session is closed using the CONNECTION\_CLOSE frame
({{QUIC, Section 19.19}}).  When WebTransport is used, the session is
closed using the CLOSE\_WEBTRANSPORT\_SESSION capsule ({{WebTransport,
Section 5}}).

When terminating the Session, the application MAY use any error message
and SHOULD use a relevant code, as defined below:

|------|---------------------------|
| Code | Reason                    |
|-----:|:--------------------------|
| 0x0  | No Error                  |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x1  | Internal Error            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x2  | Unauthorized              |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x3  | Protocol Violation        |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x4  | Invalid Request ID        |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x5  | Duplicate Track Alias     |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x6  | Key-Value Formatting Error|
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x7  | Too Many Requests         |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x8  | Invalid Path              |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x9  | Malformed Path            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x10 | GOAWAY Timeout            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x11 | Control Message Timeout   |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x12 | Data Stream Timeout       |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x13 | Auth Token Cache Overflow |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x14 | Duplicate Auth Token Alias|
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x15 | Version Negotiation Failed|
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x16 | Malformed Auth Token      |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x17 | Unknown Auth Token Alias  |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x18 | Expired Auth Token        |
|------|---------------------------|

* No Error: The session is being terminated without an error.

* Internal Error: An implementation specific error occurred.

* Unauthorized: The client is not authorized to establish a session.

* Protocol Violation: The remote endpoint performed an action that was
  disallowed by the specification.

* Invalid Request ID: The session was closed because the endpoint used a Request
  ID that was smaller than or equal to a previously received request ID, or the
  least-significant bit of the request ID was incorrect for the endpoint.

* Duplicate Track Alias: The endpoint attempted to use a Track Alias
  that was already in use.

* Key-Value Formatting Error: the key-value pair has a formatting error.

* Too Many Requests: The session was closed because the endpoint used a
  Request ID equal to or larger than the current Maximum Request ID.

* Invalid Path: The PATH parameter was used by a server, on a WebTransport
  session, or the server does not support the path.

* Malformed Path: The PATH parameter does not conform to the rules in {{path}}.

* GOAWAY Timeout: The session was closed because the peer took too long to
  close the session in response to a GOAWAY ({{message-goaway}}) message.
  See session migration ({{session-migration}}).

* Control Message Timeout: The session was closed because the peer took too
  long to respond to a control message.

* Data Stream Timeout: The session was closed because the peer took too long to
  send data expected on an open Data Stream (see {{data-streams}}).  This
  includes fields of a stream header or an object header within a data
  stream. If an endpoint times out waiting for a new object header on an open
  subgroup stream, it MAY send a STOP_SENDING on that stream or terminate the
  subscription.

* Auth Token Cache Overflow - the Session limit {{max-auth-token-cache-size}} of
  the size of all registered Authorization tokens has been exceeded.

* Duplicate Auth Token Alias - Authorization Token attempted to register an
  Alias that was in use (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Version Negotiation Failed: The client didn't offer a version supported
  by the server.

* Malformed Auth Token - Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration
  (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Unknown Auth Token Alias - No registered token found for the provided Alias
  (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Expired Auth Token - Authorization token has expired {{authorization-token}}).

An endpoint MAY choose to treat a subscription or request specific error as a
session error under certain circumstances, closing the entire session in
response to a condition with a single subscription or message. Implementations
need to consider the impact on other outstanding subscriptions before making
this choice.

## Migration {#session-migration}

MOQT requires a long-lived and stateful session. However, a service
provider needs the ability to shutdown/restart a server without waiting for all
sessions to drain naturally, as that can take days for long-form media.
MOQT enables proactively draining sessions via the GOAWAY message ({{message-goaway}}).

The server sends a GOAWAY message, signaling the client to establish a new
session and migrate any active subscriptions. The GOAWAY message optionally
contains a new URI for the new session, otherwise the current URI is
reused. The server SHOULD terminate the session with 'GOAWAY Timeout' after a
sufficient timeout if there are still open subscriptions or fetches on a
connection.

When the server is a subscriber, it SHOULD send a GOAWAY message to downstream
subscribers prior to any UNSUBSCRIBE messages to upstream publishers.

After the client receives a GOAWAY, it's RECOMMENDED that the client waits until
there are no more active subscriptions before closing the session with NO_ERROR.
Ideally this is transparent to the application using MOQT, which involves
establishing a new session in the background and migrating active subscriptions
and announcements. The client can choose to delay closing the session if it
expects more OBJECTs to be delivered. The server closes the session with a
'GOAWAY Timeout' if the client doesn't close the session quickly enough.

## Congestion Control

MOQT does not specify a congestion controller, but there are important attributes
to consider when selecting a congestion controller for use with an application
built on top of MOQT.

### Bufferbloat

Traditional AIMD congestion controllers (ex. CUBIC {{?RFC9438}} and Reno {{?RFC6582}})
are prone to Bufferbloat. Bufferbloat occurs when elements along the path build up
a substantial queue of packets, commonly more than doubling the round trip time.
These queued packets cause head-of-line blocking and latency, even when there is
no packet loss.

### Application-Limited

The average bitrate for latency sensitive content needs to be less than the available
bandwidth, otherwise data will be queued and/or dropped. As such,
many MOQT applications will typically be limited by the available data to send, and
not the congestion controller. Many congestion control algorithms
only increase the congestion window or bandwidth estimate if fully utilized. This
combination can lead to underestimating the available network bandwidth. As a result,
applications might need to periodically ensure the congestion controller is not
app-limited for at least a full round trip to ensure the available bandwidth can be
measured.

### Consistent Throughput

Congestion control algorithms are commonly optimized for throughput, not consistency.
For example, BBR's PROBE_RTT state halves the sending rate for more than a round trip
in order to obtain an accurate minimum RTT. Similarly, Reno halves it's congestion
window upon detecting loss.  In both cases, the large reduction in sending rate might
cause issues with latency sensitive applications.

# Publishing and Retrieving Tracks

## Subscriptions

A subscription can be initiated by either a publisher or a subscriber.  A
publisher initiates a subscription to a track by sending the PUBLISH message.
The subscriber either accepts or rejects the subscription using PUBLISH_OK or
PUBLISH_ERROR.  A subscriber initiates a subscription to a track by sending the
SUBSCRIBE message.  The publisher either accepts or rejects the subscription
using SUBSCRIBE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR.  Once either of these sequences is
successful, the subscription can be updated by the subscriber using
SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE, terminated by the subscriber using UNSUBSCRIBE, or terminated
by the publisher using SUBSCRIBE_DONE.

All subscriptions have a Forward State which is either 0 or 1.  If the Forward
State is 0, the publisher does not send objects for the subscription.  If the
Forward State is 1, the publisher sends objects.  The initiator of the
subscription sets the initial Forward State in either PUBLISH or SUBSCRIBE.  The
sender of PUBLISH_OK can update the Forward State based on its preference.  Once
the subscription is established, the subscriber can update the Forward State by
sending SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE.

Either endpoint can initiate a subscription to a track without exchanging any
prior messages other than SETUP.  Relays MUST NOT send any PUBLISH messages
without knowing the client is interested in and authorized to receive the
content. The communication of intent and authorization can be accomplished by
the client sending SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, or conveyed in other mechanisms out of
band.

A publisher MUST send exactly one SUBSCRIBE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR in response to
a SUBSCRIBE. It MUST send exactly one FETCH_OK or FETCH_ERROR in response to a
FETCH. A subscriber MUST send exactly one PUBLISH_OK or PUBLISH_ERROR in
response to a PUBLISH. The peer SHOULD close the session with a protocol error
if it receives more than one.

A subscriber keeps subscription state until it sends UNSUBSCRIBE, or after
receipt of a SUBSCRIBE_DONE or SUBSCRIBE_ERROR. Note that SUBSCRIBE_DONE does
not usually indicate that state can immediately be destroyed, see
{{message-subscribe-done}}.

A subscriber keeps FETCH state until it sends FETCH_CANCEL, receives
FETCH_ERROR, or receives a FIN or RESET_STREAM for the FETCH data stream. If the
data stream is already open, it MAY send STOP_SENDING for the data stream along
with FETCH_CANCEL, but MUST send FETCH_CANCEL.

The Publisher can destroy subscription or fetch state as soon as it has received
UNSUBSCRIBE or FETCH_CANCEL, respectively. It MUST reset any open streams
associated with the SUBSCRIBE or FETCH. It can also destroy state after closing
the FETCH data stream.

The publisher can immediately delete subscription state after sending
SUBSCRIBE_DONE, but MUST NOT send it until it has closed all related streams. It
can destroy all FETCH state after closing the data stream.

A SUBSCRIBE_ERROR indicates no objects will be delivered, and both endpoints can
immediately destroy relevant state. Objects MUST NOT be sent for requests that
end with an error.

A FETCH_ERROR indicates that both endpoints can immediately destroy state.
Since a relay can start delivering FETCH Objects from cache before determining
the result of the request, some Objects could be received even if the FETCH
results in error.

The Parameters in SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH_OK and FETCH MUST NOT cause the publisher
to alter the payload of the objects it sends, as that would violate the track
uniqueness guarantee described in {{track-scope}}.

# Namespace Discovery {#track-discovery}

Discovery of MOQT servers is always done out-of-band. Namespace discovery can be
done in the context of an established MOQT session.

Given sufficient out of band information, it is valid for a subscriber to send a
SUBSCRIBE or FETCH message to a publisher (including a relay) without any
previous MoQT messages besides SETUP. However, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, PUBLISH and
ANNOUNCE messages provide an in-band means of discovery of publishers for a
namespace.

The syntax of these messages is described in {{message}}.


## Subscribing to Namespaces

If the subscriber is aware of a namespace of interest, it can send
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE to publishers/relays it has established a session with. The
recipient of this message will send any relevant ANNOUNCE, UNANNOUNCE or PUBLISH
messages for that namespace, or more specific part of that namespace.

A publisher MUST send exactly one SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR in response to a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE. The subscriber
SHOULD close the session with a protocol error if it detects receiving more than
one.

The receiver of a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR ought to
forward the result to the application, so the application can decide which other
publishers to contact, if any.

An UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE withdraws a previous SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE. It does not
prohibit original publishers from sending further ANNOUNCE or PUBLISH messages,
but relays MUST NOT send any further PUBLISH messages to a client without
knowing the client is interested in and authorized to receive the content.

## Announcements

A publisher MAY send ANNOUNCE messages to any subscriber. An ANNOUNCE indicates
to the subscriber that the publisher has tracks available in that namespace. A
subscriber MAY send SUBSCRIBE or FETCH for tracks in a namespace without having
received an ANNOUNCE for it.

If a publisher is authoritative for a given namespace, or is a relay that has
received an authorized ANNOUNCE for that namespace from an upstream publisher,
it MUST send an ANNOUNCE to any subscriber that has subscribed to ANNOUNCE for
that namespace, or a more generic set including that namespace. A publisher MAY
send the ANNOUNCE to any other subscriber.

An endpoint SHOULD NOT, however, send an ANNOUNCE advertising a namespace that
exactly matches a namespace for which the peer sent an earlier ANNOUNCE
(i.e. an ANNOUNCE ought not to be echoed back to its sender).

The receiver of an ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR SHOULD report this to the
application to inform the search for additional subscribers for a namespace,
or abandoning the attempt to publish under this namespace. This might be
especially useful in upload or chat applications. A subscriber MUST send exactly
one ANNOUNCE_OK or ANNOUNCE_ERROR in response to an ANNOUNCE. The publisher
SHOULD close the session with a protocol error if it receives more than one.

An UNANNOUNCE message withdraws a previous ANNOUNCE, although it is not a
protocol error for the subscriber to send a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH message for a
track in a namespace after receiving an UNANNOUNCE.

A subscriber can send ANNOUNCE_CANCEL to revoke acceptance of an ANNOUNCE, for
example due to expiration of authorization credentials. The message enables the
publisher to ANNOUNCE again with refreshed authorization, or discard associated
state. After receiving an ANNOUNCE_CANCEL, the publisher does not send
UNANNOUNCE.

While ANNOUNCE indicates to relays how to connect publishers and subscribers, it
is not a full-fledged routing protocol and does not protect against loops and
other phenomena. In particular, ANNOUNCE SHOULD NOT be used to find paths
through richly connected networks of relays.

A subscriber MAY send a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH for a track to any publisher. If it
has accepted an ANNOUNCE with a namespace that exactly matches the namespace for
that track, it SHOULD only request it from the senders of those ANNOUNCE
messages.


# Priorities {#priorities}

MoQ priorities allow a subscriber and original publisher to influence
the transmission order of Objects within a session in the presence of
congestion.

## Definitions

MOQT maintains priorities between different _schedulable objects_.
A schedulable object in MOQT is either:

1. An object in response to a SUBSCRIBE that belongs to a subgroup where
   that object is the next object in that subgroup.
2. An object in response to a SUBSCRIBE that belongs to a track with
   delivery preference Datagram.
3. An object in response to a FETCH where that object is the next
   object in the response.

A single subgroup or datagram has a single publisher priority. Within a
response to SUBSCRIBE, it can be useful to conceptualize this process as
scheduling subgroups or datagrams instead of individual objects on them.
FETCH responses however can contain objects with different publisher
priorities.

A _priority number_ is an unsigned integer with a value between 0 and 255.
A lower priority number indicates higher priority; the highest priority is 0.

_Subscriber Priority_ is a priority number associated with an individual
request.  It is specified in the SUBSCRIBE or FETCH message, and can be
updated via SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE message.  The subscriber priority of an individual
schedulable object is the subscriber priority of the request that caused that
object to be sent. When subscriber priority is changed, a best effort SHOULD be
made to apply the change to all objects that have not been sent, but it is
implementation dependent what happens to objects that have already been
received and possibly scheduled.

_Publisher Priority_ is a priority number associated with an individual
schedulable object.  It is specified in the header of the respective subgroup or
datagram, or in each object in a FETCH response.

_Group Order_ is a property of an individual subscription.  It can be either
'Ascending' (groups with lower group ID are sent first), or 'Descending'
(groups with higher group ID are sent first).  The subscriber optionally
communicates its group order preference in the SUBSCRIBE message; the
publisher's preference is used if the subscriber did not express one (by
setting Group Order field to value 0x0).  The group order of an existing
subscription cannot be changed.

## Scheduling Algorithm

When an MOQT publisher has multiple schedulable objects it can choose between,
the objects SHOULD be selected as follows:

1. If two objects have different subscriber priorities associated with them,
   the one with **the highest subscriber priority** is sent first.
1. If two objects have the same subscriber priority, but different publisher
   priorities, the one with **the highest publisher priority** is sent first.
2. If two objects in response to the same request have the same subscriber
   and publisher priority, but belong to two different groups of the same track,
   **the group order** of the associated subscription is used to
   decide the one that is sent first.
3. If two objects in response to the same request belong to the same group of
   the same track, the one with **the lowest Subgroup ID** (for tracks
   with delivery preference Subgroup), or **the lowest Object ID** (for tracks
   with delivery preference Datagram) is sent first.

The definition of "sent first" in the algorithm is implementation dependent and
is constrained by the prioritization interface of the underlying transport.
For some implementations, it could mean that the object is serialized and
passed to the underlying transport first.  In other implementations, it can
control the order packets are initially transmitted.

This algorithm does not provide a well-defined ordering for objects that belong
to different subscriptions or FETCH responses, but have the same subscriber and
publisher priority.  The ordering in those cases is implementation-defined,
though the expectation is that all subscriptions will be able to send some data.

Given the critical nature of control messages and their relatively
small size, the control stream SHOULD be prioritized higher than all
subscribed Objects.

## Considerations for Setting Priorities

For downstream subscriptions, relays SHOULD respect the subscriber and original
publisher's priorities.  Relays can receive subscriptions with conflicting
subscriber priorities or Group Order preferences.  Relays SHOULD NOT directly
use Subscriber Priority or Group Order from incoming subscriptions for upstream
subscriptions. Relays' use of these fields for upstream subscriptions can be
based on factors specific to it, such as the popularity of the content or
policy, or relays can specify the same value for all upstream subscriptions.

MoQ Sessions can span multiple namespaces, and priorities might not
be coordinated across namespaces.  The subscriber's priority is
considered first, so there is a mechanism for a subscriber to fix
incompatibilities between different namespaces prioritization schemes.
Additionally, it is anticipated that when multiple namespaces
are present within a session, the namespaces could be coordinating,
possibly part of the same application.  In cases when pooling among
namespaces is expected to cause issues, multiple MoQ sessions, either
within a single connection or on multiple connections can be used.

Implementations that have a default priority SHOULD set it to a value in
the middle of the range (eg: 128) to allow non-default priorities to be
set either higher or lower.

# Relays {#relays-moq}

Relays are leveraged to enable distribution scale in the MoQ
architecture. Relays can be used to form an overlay delivery network,
similar in functionality to Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs). Additionally, relays serve as policy enforcement points by
validating subscribe and publish requests at the edge of a network.

Relays are endpoints, which means they terminate Transport Sessions in order to
have visibility of MoQ Object metadata.

## Caching Relays

Relays MAY cache Objects, but are not required to.

A caching relay saves Objects to its cache identified by the Object's Full Track
Name, Group ID and Object ID. If multiple objects are received with the same
Full Track Name, Group ID and Object ID, Relays MAY ignore subsequently received
Objects or MAY use them to update certain cached fields. Implementations that
update the cache need to protect against cache poisoning.  The only Object
fields that can be updated are the following:

1. Object Status can transition from any status to Object Does Not Exist in
   cases where the object is no longer available.  Transitions between Normal,
   End of Group and End of Track are invalid.
3. Object Header Extensions can be added, removed or updated, subject
   to the constraints of the specific header extension.

An endpoint that receives a duplicate Object with an invalid Object Status
change, or a Forwarding Preference, Subgroup ID, Priority or Payload that
differ from a previous version MUST treat the track as Malformed.

Note that due to reordering, an implementation can receive a duplicate Object
with a status of Normal, End of Group or End of Track after receiving a
previous status of Object Not Exists.  The endpoint SHOULD NOT cache or
forward the duplicate object in this case.

A cache MUST store all properties of an Object defined in
{{object-properties}}, with the exception of any extensions
({{object-extensions}}) that specify otherwise.

## Subscriber Interactions

Subscribers subscribe to tracks by sending a SUBSCRIBE
({{message-subscribe-req}}) control message for each track of
interest. Relays MUST ensure subscribers are authorized to access the
content associated with the track. The authorization
information can be part of subscription request itself or part of the
encompassing session. The specifics of how a relay authorizes a user are outside
the scope of this specification.

The relay MUST have an established upstream subscription before sending
SUBSCRIBE_OK in response to a downstream SUBSCRIBE.  If a relay does not have
sufficient information to send a FETCH_OK immediately in response to a FETCH, it
MUST withhold sending FETCH_OK until it does.

For successful subscriptions, the publisher maintains a list of
subscribers for each track. Each new Object belonging to the
track within the subscription range is forwarded to each active
subscriber, dependent on the congestion response.

Relays MUST be able to process objects for the same Full Track Name from
multiple publishers and forward objects to active matching subscriptions.  The
same object SHOULD NOT be forwarded more than once on the same subscription.

A relay MUST NOT reorder or drop objects received on a multi-object stream when
forwarding to subscribers, unless it has application specific information.

Relays MAY aggregate authorized subscriptions for a given track when
multiple subscribers request the same track. Subscription aggregation
allows relays to make only a single upstream subscription for the
track. The published content received from the upstream subscription
request is cached and shared among the pending subscribers.
Because SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE only allows narrowing a subscription, relays that
aggregate upstream subscriptions can subscribe using the Largest Object
filter to avoid churn as downstream subscribers with disparate filters
subscribe and unsubscribe from a track.

### Graceful Subscriber Relay Switchover

This section describes behavior a subscriber MAY implement
to allow for a better user experience when a relay sends a GOAWAY.

When a subscriber receives the GOAWAY message, it starts the process
of connecting to a new relay and sending the SUBSCRIBE requests for
all active subscriptions to the new relay. The new relay will send a
response to the subscribes and if they are successful, the subscriptions
to the old relay can be stopped with an UNSUBSCRIBE.


## Publisher Interactions

There are two ways to publish through a relay:

1. Send a PUBLISH message for a specific Track to the relay. The relay MAY
respond with PUBLISH_OK in Forward State=0 until there are known subscribers for
new tracks.

2. Send an ANNOUNCE message for a Track Namespace to the relay. This enables the
relay to send SUBSCRIBE messages to publishers for Tracks in this Namespace in
response to received SUBSCRIBE messages.

Relays MUST verify that publishers are authorized to publish the set of tracks
whose Track Namespace matches the namespace in
an ANNOUNCE, or the Full Track Name in PUBLISH. The authorization and
identification of the publisher depends on the way the relay is managed
and is application specific.

A Relay can receive announcements for the same Track Namespace or PUBLISH
messages for the same Track from multiple publishers and is expected to treat
them uniformly.

When a publisher wants to stop new subscriptions for an announced namespace it
sends an UNANNOUNCE. A subscriber indicates it will no longer subcribe to tracks
in a namespace it previously responded ANNOUNCE_OK to by sending an
ANNOUNCE_CANCEL.

A relay manages sessions from multiple publishers and subscribers, connecting
them based on the Track Namespace or Full Track Name.  Prefix matching is used
to determine which publishers receive a SUBSCRIBE or which subscribers receive a
PUBLISH. For example, a SUBSCRIBE namespace=(foo,bar), track=x message will be
forwarded to the sessions that sent ANNOUNCE namespace=(foo) and ANNOUNCE
namespace=(foo, bar) respectively, but not one that sent ANNOUNCE
namespace=(foobar).  Relays MUST forward SUBSCRIBE messages to all publishers
and ANNOUNCE and PUBLISH messages to all subscribers that have a namespace
prefix match.

When a relay receives an incoming SUBSCRIBE that triggers an upstream
subscription, it SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE request to each publisher that has
announced the subscription's namespace or prefix thereof, unless it already has
an active subscription for the Objects requested by the incoming SUBSCRIBE
request from all available publishers.  If it already has a matching upstream
subscription in Forward State=0, it SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE_UDPATE with
Forward=1 to all publishers.

When a relay receives an incoming PUBLISH message, it MUST send a PUBLISH
request to each subscriber that has subscribed (via SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE)
to the track's namespace or prefix thereof.

When a relay receives an incoming ANNOUNCE for a given namespace, for
each active upstream subscription that matches that namespace, it SHOULD send a
SUBSCRIBE to the publisher that sent the ANNOUNCE.  When it receives an incoming
PUBLISH message for a track that has active subscribers, it SHOULD respond
with PUBLISH_OK with Forward State=1.

Relays use the Track Alias ({{track-alias}}) of an incoming Object to identify
its track and find the active subscribers. Relays MUST forward Objects to
matching subscribers in accordance to each subscription's priority, group order,
and delivery timeout.

If an upstream session is closed due to an unknown or invalid control message
or Object, the relay MUST NOT continue to propagate that message or Object
downstream, because it would enable a single session to close unrelated
sessions.

### Graceful Publisher Network Switchover

This section describes a behavior that a publisher MAY
choose to implement to allow for a better user experience when
switching between networks, such as WiFi to Cellular or vice versa.

If the original publisher detects it is likely to need to switch networks, for
example because the WiFi signal is getting weaker, and it does not have QUIC
connection migration available, it establishes a new session over the new
interface and sends ANNOUNCE and/or PUBLISH messages. The relay will establish
subscriptions and the publisher publishes objects on both sessions.  Once the
subscriptions have migrated over to session on the new network, the publisher
can stop publishing objects on the old network. The relay will drop duplicate
objects received on both subscriptions.  Ideally, the subscriptions downstream
from the relay do no observe this change, and keep receiving the objects on the
same subscription.

### Graceful Publisher Relay Switchover

This section describes a behavior that a publisher MAY choose to implement
to allow for a better user experience when a relay sends them a GOAWAY.

When a publisher receives a GOAWAY, it starts the process of connecting to a new
relay and sends ANNOUNCE and/or PUBLISH messages, but it does not immediately
stop publishing objects to the old relay. The new relay will establish
subscriptions and the publisher can start sending new objects to the new relay
instead of the old relay. Once objects are going to the new relay, the
announcements and subscriptions to the old relay can be withdrawn or terminated.

## Relay Object Handling

MOQT encodes the delivery information via Object headers
({{message-object}}).  A relay MUST NOT modify Object properties when
forwarding, except for Object Extension Headers as specified in
{{object-extensions}}.

A relay MUST treat the object payload as opaque.  A relay MUST NOT
combine, split, or otherwise modify object payloads.  A relay SHOULD
prioritize sending Objects based on {{priorities}}.

A publisher SHOULD begin sending incomplete objects when available to
avoid incurring additional latency.

A relay that reads from one stream and writes to another in order can
introduce head-of-line blocking.  Packet loss will cause stream data to
be buffered in the library, awaiting in-order delivery, which could
increase latency over additional hops.  To mitigate this, a relay MAY
read and write stream data out of order subject to flow control
limits.  See section 2.2 in {{QUIC}}.

# Control Messages {#message}

MOQT uses a single bidirectional stream to exchange control messages, as
defined in {{session-init}}.  Every single message on the control stream is
formatted as follows:

~~~
MOQT Control Message {
  Message Type (i),
  Message Length (16),
  Message Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-message-format title="MOQT Message"}

The following Message Types are defined:

|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|

An endpoint that receives an unknown message type MUST close the session.
Control messages have a length to make parsing easier, but no control messages
are intended to be ignored. The length is set to the number of bytes in Message
Payload, which is defined by each message type.  If the length does not match
the length of the Message Payload, the receiver MUST close the session with
Protocol Violation.

## Request ID

Most MOQT control messages contain a session specific Request ID.  The Request
ID correlates requests and responses, allows endpoints to update or terminate
ongoing requests, and supports the endpoint's ability to limit the concurrency
and frequency of requests.  There are independent Request IDs for each endpoint.
The client's Request ID starts at 0 and are even and the server's Request ID
starts at 1 and are odd.  The Request ID increments by 2 with ANNOUNCE, FETCH,
SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE or TRACK_STATUS request.  If an endpoint receives
a Request ID that is not valid for the peer, or a new request with a Request ID
that is not expected, it MUST close the session with `Invalid Request ID`.

## Parameters {#params}

Some messages include a Parameters field that encodes optional message
elements.

Senders MUST NOT repeat the same parameter type in a message unless the
parameter definition explicitly allows multiple instances of that type to
be sent in a single message. Receivers SHOULD check that there are no
unauthorized duplicate parameters and close the session as a
'Protocol Violation' if found.  Receivers MUST allow duplicates of unknown
parameters.

Receivers ignore unrecognized parameters.

The number of parameters in a message is not specifically limited, but the
total length of a control message is limited to 2^16-1 bytes.

Parameters are serialized as Key-Value-Pairs {{moq-key-value-pair}}.

Setup message parameters use a namespace that is constant across all MoQ
Transport versions. All other messages use a version-specific namespace.
For example, the integer '1' can refer to different parameters for Setup
messages and for all other message types. SETUP message parameter types
are defined in {{setup-params}}. Version-specific parameter types are defined
in {{version-specific-params}}.

### Version Specific Parameters {#version-specific-params}

Each version-specific parameter definition indicates the message types in which
it can appear. If it appears in some other type of message, it MUST be ignored.
Note that since Setup parameters use a separate namespace, it is impossible for
these parameters to appear in Setup messages.

#### AUTHORIZATION TOKEN {#authorization-token}

The AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter (Parameter Type 0x03) MAY appear in a
CLIENT_SETUP, SERVER_SETUP, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, ANNOUNCE,
TRACK_STATUS or FETCH message. This parameter conveys information to authorize
the sender to perform the operation carrying the parameter.

The AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter MAY be repeated within a message.

The parameter value is a Token structure containing an optional Session-specific
Alias. The Alias allows the sender to reference a previously transmitted Token
Type and Token Value in future messages. The Token structure is serialized as
follows:

~~~
Token {
  Alias Type (i),
  [Token Alias (i),]
  [Token Type (i),]
  [Token Value (..)]
}
~~~
{: #moq-token format title="Token structure"}

* Alias Type - an integer defining both the serialization and the processing
  behavior of the receiver. This Alias type has the following code points:

|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Code | Name       | Serialization and behavior                           |

| 0x0  | DELETE     | There is an Alias but no Type or Value. This Alias   |
|      |            | and the Token Value it was previously associated with|
|      |            | MUST be retired. Retiring removes them from the pool |
|      |            | of actively registered tokens.                       |

|      |            | is termed "registering" the Token.                   |

|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|


* Token Alias - a Session-specific integer identifier that references a Token
  Value. There are separate Alias spaces for the client and server (e.g.: they
  can each register Alias=1). Once a Token Alias has been registered, it cannot
  be re-registered by the same sender in the Session without first being
  deleted. Use of the Token Alias is optional.

* Token Type - a numeric identifier for the type of Token payload being
  transmitted. This type is defined by the IANA table "MOQT Auth Token Type" (see
  {{iana}}). Type 0 is reserved to indicate that the type is not defined in the
  table and is negotiated out-of-band between client and receiver.

* Token Value - the payload of the Token. The contents and serialization of this
  payload are defined by the Token Type.

If the Token structure cannot be decoded, the receiver MUST close the Session
with Key-Value Formatting error.  The receiver of a message attempting to
register an Alias which is already registered MUST close the Session with
`Duplicate Auth Token Alias`. The receiver of a message referencing an Alias
that is not currently registered MUST reject the message with `Unknown Auth
Token Alias`.

The receiver of a message containing a well-formed Token structure but otherwise
invalid AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter MUST reject that message with an
`Malformed Auth Token` error.

The receiver of a message carrying an AUTHORIZATION TOKEN with Alias Type
REGISTER that does not result in a Session error MUST register the Token Alias,
in the token cache, even if the message fails for other reasons, including
`Unauthorized`.  This allows senders to pipeline messages that refer to
previously registered tokens without potentially terminating the entire Session.
A receiver MAY store an error code (eg: Unauthorized or Malformed Auth Token) in
place of the Token Type and Token Alias if any future message referencing the
Token Alias will result in that error. The size of a registered cache entry
includes the length of the Token Value, regardless of whether it is stored.

If a receiver detects that an authorization token has expired, it MUST retain
the registered Alias until it is deleted by the sender, though it MAY discard
other state associated with the token that is no longer needed.  Expiration does
not affect the size occupied by a token in the token cache.  Any message that
references the token with Alias Type USE_ALIAS fails with `Expired Auth Token`.

Using an Alias to refer to a previously registered Token Type and Value is for
efficiency only and has the same effect as if the Token Type and Value was
included directly.  Retiring an Alias that was previously used to authorize a
message has no retroactive effect on the original authorization, nor does it
prevent that same Token Type and Value from being re-registered.

Senders of tokens SHOULD only register tokens which they intend to re-use during
the Session and SHOULD retire previously registered tokens once their utility
has passed.

By registering a Token, the sender is requiring the receiver to store the Token
Alias and Token Value until they are deleted, or the Session ends. The receiver
can protect its resources by sending a SETUP parameter defining the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE limit (see {{max-auth-token-cache-size}}) it is
willing to accept. If a registration is attempted which would cause this limit
to be exceeded, the receiver MUST termiate the Session with a `Auth Token Cache
Overflow` error.


#### DELIVERY TIMEOUT Parameter {#delivery-timeout}

The DELIVERY TIMEOUT parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) MAY appear in a
TRACK_STATUS, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_OK, or SUBSCRIBE_UDPATE message.
It is the duration in milliseconds the relay SHOULD continue to attempt
forwarding Objects after they have been received.  The start time for the
timeout is based on when the beginning of the Object is received, and does
not depend upon the forwarding preference. There is no explicit signal that
an Object was not sent because the delivery timeout was exceeded.

If both the subscriber and publisher specify the parameter, they use the min of
the two values for the subscription.  The publisher SHOULD always specify the
value received from an upstream subscription when there is one, and nothing
otherwise.  If an Object with a smaller ID arrives later than subsequent
Objects, relays can consider its receipt time as that of the Object with the
next larger Location, with the assumption that the Objects were reordered.

Publishers can, at their discretion, discontinue forwarding Objects earlier than
the negotiated DELIVERY TIMEOUT, subject to stream closure and ordering
constraints described in {{closing-subgroup-streams}}.  However, if neither the
subscriber or publisher specify DELIVERY TIMEOUT, all Objects in the track
matching the subscription filter are delivered as indicated by their Group Order
and Priority.  If a subscriber fails to consume Objects at a sufficient rate,
causing the publisher to exceed its resource limits, the publisher MAY terminate
the subscription with error 'Too Far Behind'.

If an object in a subgroup exceeds the delivery timeout, the publisher MUST
reset the underlying transport stream (see {{closing-subgroup-streams}}).

When sent by a subscriber, this parameter is intended to be specific to a
subscription, so it SHOULD NOT be forwarded upstream by a relay that intends
to serve multiple subscriptions for the same track.

Publishers SHOULD consider whether the entire Object is likely to be delivered
before sending any data for that Object, taking into account priorities,
congestion control, and any other relevant information.

#### MAX CACHE DURATION Parameter {#max-cache-duration}

The MAX_CACHE_DURATION parameter (Parameter Type 0x04) MAY appear in a
SUBSCRIBE_OK, FETCH_OK or TRACK_STATUS message.  It is an integer expressing
the number of milliseconds an object can be served from a cache. If present,
the relay MUST NOT start forwarding any individual Object received through
this subscription or fetch after the specified number of milliseconds has
elapsed since the beginning of the Object was received.  This means Objects
earlier in a multi-object stream will expire earlier than Objects later in the
stream. Once Objects have expired from cache, their state becomes unknown, and
a relay that handles a downstream request that includes those Objects
re-requests them.

## CLIENT_SETUP and SERVER_SETUP {#message-setup}

The `CLIENT_SETUP` and `SERVER_SETUP` messages are the first messages exchanged
by the client and the server; they allow the endpoints to establish the mutually
supported version and agree on the initial configuration before any objects are
exchanged. It is a sequence of key-value pairs called Setup parameters; the
semantics and format of which can vary based on whether the client or server is
sending.  To ensure future extensibility of MOQT, endpoints MUST ignore unknown
setup parameters. TODO: describe GREASE for those.

The wire format of the Setup messages are as follows:

~~~
CLIENT_SETUP Message {
  Type (i) = 0x20,
  Length (16),
  Number of Supported Versions (i),
  Supported Versions (i) ...,
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Setup Parameters (..) ...,
}

SERVER_SETUP Message {
  Type (i) = 0x21,
  Length (16),
  Selected Version (i),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Setup Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-setup-format title="MOQT Setup Messages"}

The available versions and Setup parameters are detailed in the next sections.

### Versions {#setup-versions}

MOQT versions are a 32-bit unsigned integer, encoded as a varint.
This version of the specification is identified by the number 0x00000001.
Versions with the most significant 16 bits of the version number cleared are
reserved for use in future IETF consensus documents.

The client offers the list of the protocol versions it supports; the
server MUST reply with one of the versions offered by the client. If the
server does not support any of the versions offered by the client, or
the client receives a server version that it did not offer, the
corresponding peer MUST close the session with `Version Negotiation Failed`.

\[\[RFC editor: please remove the remainder of this section before
publication.]]

The version number for the final version of this specification (0x00000001), is
reserved for the version of the protocol that is published as an RFC.
Version numbers used to identify IETF drafts are created by adding the draft
number to 0xff000000. For example, draft-ietf-moq-transport-13 would be
identified as 0xff00000D.

### Setup Parameters {#setup-params}

#### PATH {#path}

The PATH parameter (Parameter Type 0x01) allows the client to specify the path
of the MoQ URI when using native QUIC ({{QUIC}}).  It MUST NOT be used by
the server, or when WebTransport is used.  When a PATH parameter is received
from a server, or when a PATH parameter is received while WebTransport is used,
or when a PATH parameter is received by a server but the server does not
support the specified path, the session MUST be closed with Invalid Path.

The PATH parameter follows the URI formatting rules {{!RFC3986}}.
When connecting to a server using a URI with the "moqt" scheme, the
client MUST set the PATH parameter to the `path-abempty` portion of the
URI; if `query` is present, the client MUST concatenate `?`, followed by
the `query` portion of the URI to the parameter. If a PATH does not conform to
these rules, the session MUST be closed with Malformed Path.

#### MAX_REQUEST_ID {#max-request-id}

The MAX_REQUEST_ID parameter (Parameter Type 0x02) communicates an initial
value for the Maximum Request ID to the receiving endpoint. The default
value is 0, so if not specified, the peer MUST NOT send requests.

#### MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE {#max-auth-token-cache-size}

The MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter (Parameter Type 0x04) communicates the
maximum size in bytes of all actively registered Authorization tokens that the
server is willing to store per Session. This parameter is optional. The default
value is 0 which prohibits the use of token Aliases.

The token size is calculated as 16 bytes + the size of the Token Value field
(see {{moq-token}}). The total size as restricted by the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter is calculated as the sum of the token sizes
for all registered tokens (Alias Type value of 0x01) minus the sum of the token
sizes for all deregistered tokens (Alias Type value of 0x00), since Session
initiation.

#### AUTHORIZATION TOKEN {#setup-auth-token}

See {{authorization-token}}.  The endpoint can specify one or more tokens in
CLIENT_SETUP or SERVER_SETUP that the peer can use to authorize MOQT session
establishment.

If a server receives an AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter in CLIENT_SETUP with Alias
Type REGISTER_TOKEN that exceeds its MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE, it MUST NOT fail
the session with `Auth Token Cache Overflow`.  Instead, it MUST treat the
parameter as Alias Type USE_VALUE.  A client MUST handle registration failures
of this kind by purging any Token Aliases that failed to register based on the
MAX_AUTH_TOKEN_CACHE_SIZE parameter in SERVER_SETUP (or the default value of 0).

## GOAWAY {#message-goaway}

An endpoint sends a `GOAWAY` message to inform the peer it intends to close
the session soon.  Servers can use GOAWAY to initiate session migration
({{session-migration}}) with an optional URI.

The GOAWAY message does not impact subscription state. A subscriber
SHOULD individually UNSUBSCRIBE for each existing subscription, while a
publisher MAY reject new requests while in the draining state.

Upon receiving a GOAWAY, an endpoint SHOULD NOT initiate new requests to
the peer including SUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, FETCH, ANNOUNCE and SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE.

The endpoint MUST terminate the session with a Protocol Violation
({{session-termination}}) if it receives multiple GOAWAY messages.

~~~
GOAWAY Message {
  Type (i) = 0x10,
  Length (16),
  New Session URI Length (i),
  New Session URI (..),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-goaway-format title="MOQT GOAWAY Message"}

* New Session URI: When received by a client, indicates where the client can
  connect to continue this session.  The client MUST use this URI for the new
  session if provided. If the URI is zero bytes long, the current URI is reused
  instead. The new session URI SHOULD use the same scheme
  as the current URL to ensure compatibility.  The maxmimum length of the New
  Session URI is 8,192 bytes.  If an endpoint receives a length exceeding the
  maximum, it MUST close the session with a Protocol Violation.

  If a server receives a GOAWAY with a non-zero New Session URI Length it MUST
  terminate the session with a Protocol Violation.

## MAX_REQUEST_ID {#message-max-request-id}

An endpoint sends a MAX_REQUEST_ID message to increase the number of requests
the peer can send within a session.

The Maximum Request ID MUST only increase within a session, and
receipt of a MAX_REQUEST_ID message with an equal or smaller Request ID
value is a 'Protocol Violation'.

~~~
MAX_REQUEST_ID Message {
  Type (i) = 0x15,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-max-request-id format title="MOQT MAX_REQUEST_ID Message"}

* Request ID: The new Maximum Request ID for the session plus one. If a Request
  ID equal or larger than this is received by the endpoint that sent the
  MAX_REQUEST_ID in any request message (ANNOUNCE, FETCH, SUBSCRIBE,
  SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE or TRACK_STATUS), the endpoint MUST close the session with
  an error of 'Too Many Requests'.

MAX_REQUEST_ID is similar to MAX_STREAMS in ({{?RFC9000, Section 4.6}}), and
similar considerations apply when deciding how often to send MAX_REQUEST_ID.
For example, implementations might choose to increase MAX_REQUEST_ID as
subscriptions close to keep the number of subscriptions available roughly
consistent.

## REQUESTS_BLOCKED {#message-requests-blocked}

The REQUESTS_BLOCKED message is sent when an endpoint would like to send a new
request, but cannot because the Request ID would exceed the Maximum Request ID
value sent by the peer.  The endpoint SHOULD send only one REQUESTS_BLOCKED for
a given Maximum Request ID.

An endpoint MAY send a MAX_REQUEST_ID upon receipt of REQUESTS_BLOCKED, but it
MUST NOT rely on REQUESTS_BLOCKED to trigger sending a MAX_REQUEST_ID, because
sending REQUESTS_BLOCKED is not required.

~~~
REQUESTS_BLOCKED Message {
  Type (i) = 0x1A,
  Length (16),
  Maximum Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-requests-blocked format title="MOQT REQUESTS_BLOCKED Message"}

* Maximum Request ID: The Maximum Request ID for the session on which the
  endpoint is blocked. More on Request ID in {{message-subscribe-req}}.

## SUBSCRIBE {#message-subscribe-req}

A subscription causes the publisher to send newly published objects for a track.
A subscriber MUST NOT make multiple active subscriptions for a track within a
single session and publishers SHOULD treat this as a protocol violation.

**Filter Types**

The subscriber specifies a filter on the subscription to allow
the publisher to identify which objects need to be delivered.

All filters have a Start Location and an optional End Group.  Only objects
published or received via a subscription having Locations greater than or
equal to Start and strictly less than or equal to the End Group (when
present) pass the filter.

The `Largest Object` is defined to be the object with the largest Location
({{location-structure}}) in the track from the perspective of the endpoint
processing the SUBSCRIBE message. Largest Object updates when the first byte of
an Object with a larger Location than the previous value is published or
received through a subscription.

There are 4 types of filters:

Largest Object (0x2): The filter Start Location is `{Largest Object.Group,
Largest Object.Object + 1}` and `Largest Object` is communicated in
SUBSCRIBE_OK. If no content has been delivered yet, the filter Start Location is
{0, 0}. There is no End Group - the subscription is open ended.  Note that due
to network reordering or prioritization, relays can receive Objects with
Locations smaller than  `Largest Object` after the SUBSCRIBE is processed, but
these Objects do not pass the Largest Object filter.

Next Group Start (0x1): The filter start Location is `{Largest Object.Group + 1,
0}` and `Largest Object` is communicated in SUBSCRIBE_OK. If no content has been
delivered yet, the filter Start Location is {0, 0}.  There is no End Group -
the subscription is open ended. For scenarios where the subscriber intends to
start more than one group in the future, it can use an AbsoluteStart filter
instead.

AbsoluteStart (0x3):  The filter Start Location is specified explicitly in the
SUBSCRIBE message. The `Start` specified in the SUBSCRIBE message MAY be less
than the `Largest Object` observed at the publisher. There is no End Group - the
subscription is open ended.  To receive all Objects that are published or are
received after this subscription is processed, a subscriber can use an
AbsoluteStart filter with `Start` = {0, 0}.

AbsoluteRange (0x4):  The filer Start Location and End Group are specified
explicitly in the SUBSCRIBE message. The `Start` specified in the SUBSCRIBE
message MAY be less than the `Largest Object` observed at the publisher. If the
specified `End Group` is the same group specified in `Start`, the remainder of
that Group passes the filter. `End Group` MUST specify the same or a larger Group
than specified in `Start`.

A filter type other than the above MUST be treated as error.

Subscribe only delivers newly published or received Objects.  Objects from the
past are retrieved using FETCH ({{message-fetch}}).

A Subscription can also request a publisher to not forward Objects for a given
track by setting the `Forward` field to 0. This allows the publisher or relay to
prepare to serve the subscription in advance, reducing the time to receive
objects in the future. Relays SHOULD set the `Forward` flag to 1 if a new
subscription needs to be sent upstream, regardless of the value of the `Forward`
field from the downstream subscription. Subscriptions that are not forwarded
consume resources from the publisher, so a publisher might deprioritize, reject,
or close those subscriptions to ensure other subscriptions can be delivered.
Control messages, such as SUBCRIBE_DONE ({{message-subscribe-done}}) are still
sent.

The format of SUBSCRIBE is as follows:

~~~
SUBSCRIBE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x3,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (tuple),
  Track Name Length (i),
  Track Name (..),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Group Order (8),
  Forward (8),
  Filter Type (i),
  [Start Location (Location)],
  [End Group (i)],
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined in
({{track-name}}).

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription relative to
other subscriptions in the same session. Lower numbers get higher priority.
See {{priorities}}.

* Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
A value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's Group Order SHOULD be
used. Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Forward: If 1, Objects matching the subscription are forwarded
to the subscriber. If 0, Objects are not forwarded to the subscriber.
Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
session with a Protocol Violation ({{session-termination}}).

* Filter Type: Identifies the type of filter, which also indicates whether
the Start and End Group fields will be present.

* Start Location: The starting location for this subscriptions. Only present for
  "AbsoluteStart" and "AbsoluteRange" filter types.

* End Group: The end Group ID, inclusive. Only present for the "AbsoluteRange"
filter type.

* Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

On successful subscription, the publisher MUST reply with a SUBSCRIBE_OK,
allowing the subscriber to determine the start group/object when not explicitly
specified and the publisher SHOULD start delivering objects.

If a publisher cannot satisfy the requested start or end or if the end has
already been published it SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR with code 'Invalid Range'.
A publisher MUST NOT send objects from outside the requested start and end.

## SUBSCRIBE_OK {#message-subscribe-ok}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_OK control message for successful
subscriptions.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x4,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Alias (i),
  Expires (i),
  Group Order (8),
  Content Exists (8),
  [Largest Location (Location)],
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-ok format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Track Alias: The identifer used for this track in Subgroups or Datagrams (see
  {{track-alias}}). The same Track Alias MUST NOT be used to refer to two
  different Tracks simultaneously. If a subscriber receives a SUBSCRIBE_OK that
  uses the same Track Alias as a different track with an active subscription, it
  MUST close the session with error 'Duplicate Track Alias'.

* Expires: Time in milliseconds after which the subscription is no
longer valid. A value of 0 indicates that the subscription does not expire
or expires at an unknown time.  Expires is advisory and a subscription can
end prior to the expiry time or last longer.

* Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Content Exists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0 if not.
If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID fields will not be
present. Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
session with a Protocol Violation ({{session-termination}}).

* Largest Location: The location of the largest object available for this track. This
  field is only present if Content Exists has a value of 1.

* Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_ERROR {#message-subscribe-error}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR control message in response to a
failed SUBSCRIBE.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_ERROR Message {
  Type (i) = 0x5,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-error format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_ERROR Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for subscription failure.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for subscription error. See {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in SUBSCRIBE_ERROR,
as defined below:

|------|---------------------------|
| Code | Reason                    |
|-----:|:--------------------------|
| 0x0  | Internal Error            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x1  | Unauthorized              |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x2  | Timeout                   |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x3  | Not Supported             |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x4  | Track Does Not Exist      |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x5  | Invalid Range             |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x10 | Malformed Auth Token      |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x12 | Expired Auth Token        |
|------|---------------------------|

* Internal Error - An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

* Unauthorized - The subscriber is not authorized to subscribe to the given
  track.

* Timeout - The subscription could not be completed before an implementation
  specific timeout.  For example, a relay could not establish an upstream
  subscription within the timeout.

* Not Supported - The endpoint does not support the SUBSCRIBE method.

* Track Does Not Exist - The requested track is not available at the publisher.

* Invalid Range - The end of the SUBSCRIBE range is earlier than the beginning,
  or the end of the range has already been published.

* Malformed Auth Token - Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration
  (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Expired Auth Token - Authorization token has expired {{authorization-token}}).


## SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE {#message-subscribe-update}

A subscriber sends a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE to a publisher to modify an existing
subscription. Subscriptions can only be narrowed, not widened, as an attempt to
widen could fail. If Objects with Locations smaller than the current
subscription's Start Location are required, FETCH can be used to retrieve
them. The Start Location MUST NOT decrease, and if it increases, there is no
guarantee that the publisher has not already sent Objects with Locations smaller
than the new Start Location. Similarly, the End Group MUST NOT increase, and if
it decreases, there is no guarantee that the publisher has not already sent
Objects with Locations larger than the new End Location.  A publisher MUST
terminate the session with a 'Protocol Violation' if the SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE
violates these rules or if the subscriber specifies a request ID that has not
existed within the Session.

There is no control message in response to a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE, because it is
expected that it will always succeed and the worst outcome is that it is not
processed promptly and some extra objects from the existing subscription are
delivered.

Unlike a new subscription, SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE can not cause an Object to be
delivered multiple times.  Like SUBSCRIBE, End Group MUST be greater than or
equal to the Group specified in `Start`.

If a parameter included in `SUBSCRIBE` is not present in
`SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE`, its value remains unchanged.  There is no mechanism to
remove a parameter from a subscription.

The format of SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE is as follows:

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x2,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Start Location (Location),
  End Group (i),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Forward (8),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-update-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE ({{message-subscribe-req}}) this
  message is updating.  This MUST match an existing Request ID.

* Start Location : The starting location.

* End Group: The end Group ID, plus 1. A value of 0 means the subscription is
open-ended.

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a subscription relative to
other subscriptions in the same session. Lower numbers get higher priority.
See {{priorities}}.

* Forward: If 1, Objects matching the subscription are forwarded
to the subscriber. If 0, Objects are not forwarded to the subscriber.
Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
session with a Protocol Violation ({{session-termination}}).

* Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## UNSUBSCRIBE {#message-unsubscribe}

A subscriber issues a `UNSUBSCRIBE` message to a publisher indicating it is no
longer interested in receiving media for the specified track and requesting that
the publisher stop sending Objects as soon as possible.

The format of `UNSUBSCRIBE` is as follows:

~~~
UNSUBSCRIBE Message {
  Type (i) = 0xA,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-unsubscribe-format title="MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the subscription that is being terminated. See
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_DONE {#message-subscribe-done}

A publisher sends a `SUBSCRIBE_DONE` message to indicate it is done publishing
Objects for that subscription.  The Status Code indicates why the subscription
ended, and whether it was an error. Because SUBSCRIBE_DONE is sent on the
control stream, it is likely to arrive at the receiver before late-arriving
objects, and often even late-opening streams. However, the receiver uses it
as an indication that it should receive any late-opening streams in a relatively
short time.

Note that some objects in the subscribed track might never be delivered,
because a stream was reset, or never opened in the first place, due to the
delivery timeout.

A sender MUST NOT send SUBSCRIBE_DONE until it has closed all streams it will
ever open, and has no further datagrams to send, for a subscription. After
sending SUBSCRIBE_DONE, the sender can immediately destroy subscription state,
although stream state can persist until delivery completes. The sender might
persist subscription state to enforce the delivery timeout by resetting streams
on which it has already sent FIN, only deleting it when all such streams have
received ACK of the FIN.

A sender MUST NOT destroy subscription state until it sends SUBSCRIBE_DONE,
though it can choose to stop sending objects (and thus send SUBSCRIBE_DONE) for
any reason.

A subscriber that receives SUBSCRIBE_DONE SHOULD set a timer of at least its
delivery timeout in case some objects are still inbound due to prioritization
or packet loss. The subscriber MAY dispense with a timer if it sent UNSUBSCRIBE
or is otherwise no longer interested in objects from the track. Once the timer
has expired, the receiver destroys subscription state once all open streams for
the subscription have closed. A subscriber MAY discard subscription state
earlier, at the cost of potentially not delivering some late objects to the
application. The subscriber SHOULD send STOP_SENDING on all streams related to
the subscription when it deletes subscription state.

The format of `SUBSCRIBE_DONE` is as follows:

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message {
  Type (i) = 0xB,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Status Code (i),
  Stream Count (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase)

{: #moq-transport-subscribe-fin-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_DONE Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the subscription that is being terminated. See
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Status Code: An integer status code indicating why the subscription ended.

* Stream Count: An integer indicating the number of data streams the publisher
opened for this subscription.  This helps the subscriber know if it has received
all of the data published in this subscription by comparing the number of
streams received.  The subscriber can immediately remove all subscription state
once the same number of streams have been processed.  If the track had
Forwarding Preference = Datagram, the publisher MUST set Stream Count to 0.  If
the publisher is unable to set Stream Count to the exact number of streams
opened for the subscription, it MUST set Stream Count to 2^62 - 1. Subscribers
SHOULD use a timeout or other mechanism to remove subscription state in case
the publisher set an incorrect value, reset a stream before the SUBGROUP_HEADER,
or set the maximum value.  If a subscriber receives more streams for a
subscription than specified in Stream Count, it MAY close the session with a
Protocol Violation.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for subscription error. See {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant status code in
SUBSCRIBE_DONE, as defined below:

|------|---------------------------|
| Code | Reason                    |
|-----:|:--------------------------|
| 0x0  | Internal Error            |

|------|---------------------------|
| 0x7  | Malformed Track           |
|------|---------------------------|

* Internal Error - An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

* Unauthorized - The subscriber is no longer authorized to subscribe to the
  given track.

* Track Ended - The track is no longer being published.

* Subscription Ended - The publisher reached the end of an associated
  Subscribe filter.

* Going Away - The subscriber or publisher issued a GOAWAY message.

* Expired - The publisher reached the timeout specified in SUBSCRIBE_OK.

* Too Far Behind - The publisher's queue of objects to be sent to the given
  subscriber exceeds its implementation defined limit.

* Malformed Track - A relay publisher detected the track was malformed (see
  {{malformed-tracks}}).


## PUBLISH {#message-publish}

The publisher sends the PUBLISH control message to initiate a subscription to a
track. The receiver verifies the publisher is authorized to publish this track.

~~~
PUBLISH Message {
  Type (i) = 0x1D,
  Length (i),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (tuple),
  Track Name Length (i),

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in ({{track-name}})

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Track Alias: The identifer used for this track in Subgroups or Datagrams (see
  {{track-alias}}). The same Track Alias MUST NOT be used to refer to two
  different Tracks simultaneously. If a subscriber receives a PUBLISH that
  uses the same Track Alias as a different track with an active subscription, it
  MUST close the session with error 'Duplicate Track Alias'.

* Group Order: Indicates the subscription will be delivered in
  Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
  Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* ContentExists: 1 if an object has been published on this track, 0 if not.
  If 0, then the Largest Group ID and Largest Object ID fields will not be
  present. Any other value is a protocol error and MUST terminate the
  session with a Protocol Violation ({{session-termination}}).

* Largest: The location of the largest object available for this track.

* Forward: The forward mode for this subscription.  Any value other than 0 or 1
  is a Protocol Violation.  0 indicates the publisher will not transmit any
  objects until the subscriber sets the Forward State to 1. 1 indicates the
  publisher will start transmitting objects immediately, even before PUBLISH_OK.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.


## PUBLISH_OK {#message-publish-ok}

The subscriber sends an PUBLISH_OK control message to acknowledge the successful
authorization and acceptance of a PUBLISH message, and establish a subscription.

~~~

  implementation specific timeout.

* Not Supported - The endpoint does not support the PUBLISH method.

* Uninterested - The namespace or track is not of interest to the
  endpoint.

## FETCH {#message-fetch}

A subscriber issues a FETCH to a publisher to request a range of already
published objects within a track. The publisher responding to a FETCH is
responsible for delivering all available Objects in the requested range in the
requested order. The Objects in the response are delivered on a single
unidirectional stream. Any gaps in the Group and Object IDs in the response
stream indicate objects that do not exist (eg: they implicitly have status
`Object Does Not Exist`).  For Ascending Group Order this includes ranges
between the first requested object and the first object in the stream; between
objects in the stream; and between the last object in the stream and the Largest
Group/Object indicated in FETCH_OK, so long as the fetch stream is terminated by
a FIN.  If no Objects exist in the requested range, the publisher returns
FETCH_ERROR with code `No Objects`.

If an Original Publisher receives a FETCH with a range that includes an object with
unknown status, it MUST return FETCH_ERROR with code Unknown Status in Range.

**Fetch Types**

There are three types of Fetch messages:

Standalone Fetch (0x1) : A Fetch of Objects performed independently of any Subscribe.

Relative Joining Fetch (0x2) : A Fetch joined together with a Subscribe by
specifying the Request ID of an active subscription and a relative starting
offset. A publisher receiving a Joining Fetch uses properties of the associated
Subscribe to determine the Track Namespace, Track, Start Location,
and End Location such that it is contiguous with the associated
Subscribe. The Joining Fetch begins the Preceding Group Offset prior to the
associated subscription.

Absolute Joining Fetch (0x3) : Identical to a Relative Joining Fetch except that the
Start Group is determined by an absolute Group value rather than a relative offset to
the subscription.

A Subscriber can use a Joining Fetch to, for example, fill a playback buffer with a
certain number of groups prior to the live edge of a track.

A Joining Fetch is only permitted when the associated Subscribe has the Filter
Type Largest Object.

A Fetch Type other than 0x1, 0x2 or 0x3 MUST be treated as an error.

A publisher responds to a FETCH request with either a FETCH_OK or a FETCH_ERROR
message.  The publisher creates a new unidirectional stream that is used to send the
Objects.  The FETCH_OK or FETCH_ERROR can come at any time relative to object
delivery.

A relay that has cached objects from the beginning of the range MAY start
sending objects immediately in response to a FETCH.  If it encounters an object
in the requested range that is not cached and has unknown status, the relay MUST
pause subsequent delivery until it has confirmed the object's status upstream.
If the upstream FETCH fails, the relay sends a FETCH_ERROR and can reset the
unidirectional stream.  It can choose to do so immediately or wait until the
cached objects have been delivered before resetting the stream.

The Object Forwarding Preference does not apply to fetches.

Fetch specifies an inclusive range of Objects starting at Start Location and
ending at End Location. End Location MUST specify the same or a larger Location
than Start Location.

The format of FETCH is as follows:

~~~
FETCH Message {
  Type (i) = 0x16,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Subscriber Priority (8),
  Group Order (8),
  Fetch Type (i),
  [Track Namespace (tuple),
   Track Name Length (i),
   Track Name (..),
   Start Location (Location),
   End Location (Location),]
  [Joining Request ID (i),
   Joining Start (i),]
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-format title="MOQT FETCH Message"}

Fields common to all Fetch Types:

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Subscriber Priority: Specifies the priority of a fetch request relative to
other subscriptions or fetches in the same session. Lower numbers get higher
priority. See {{priorities}}.

* Group Order: Allows the subscriber to request Objects be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
A value of 0x0 indicates the original publisher's Group Order SHOULD be
used. Values larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* Fetch Type: Identifies the type of Fetch, whether Standalone, Relative
  Joining or Absolute Joining.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

Fields present only for Standalone Fetch (0x1):

* Track Namespace: Identifies the namespace of the track as defined in
({{track-name}}).

* Track Name: Identifies the track name as defined in ({{track-name}}).

* Start Location: The start Location.

* End Location: The end Location, plus 1 Object ID. An Object ID value of 0
  means the entire group is requested.

Fields present only for Relative Fetch (0x2) and Absolute Fetch (0x3):

* Joining Request ID: The Request ID of the existing subscription to be
  joined. If a publisher receives a Joining Fetch with a Request ID that does
  not correspond to an existing Subscribe in the same session, it MUST respond
  with a Fetch Error with code Invalid Joining Request ID.

* Joining Start : for a Relative Joining Fetch (0x2), this value represents the
  group offset for the Fetch prior and relative to the Current Group of the
  corresponding Subscribe. A value of 0 indicates the Fetch starts at the beginning
  of the Current Group. For an Absolute Joining Fetch (0x3), this value represents
  the Starting Group ID.

Objects that are not yet published will not be retrieved by a FETCH.  The
Largest available Object in the requested range is indicated in the FETCH_OK,
and is the last Object a fetch will return if the End Location have not yet been
published.

A publisher MUST send fetched groups in the determined group order, either
ascending or descending. Within each group, objects are sent in Object ID order;
subgroup ID is not used for ordering.

If Start Location is greater than the `Largest Object`
({{message-subscribe-req}}) the publisher MUST return FETCH_ERROR with error
code 'Invalid Range'.

### Calculating the Range of a Relative Joining Fetch

A publisher that receives a Fetch of type Type 0x2 treats it
as a Fetch with a range dynamically determined by the Preceding Group Offset
and field values derived from the corresponding subscription.

The Largest Location value from the corresponding
subscription is used to calculate the end of a Relative Joining Fetch so the
Objects retrieved by the FETCH and SUBSCRIBE are contiguous and non-overlapping.
If no Objects have been published for the track, and the SUBSCRIBE_OK has a
Content Exists value of 0, the publisher MUST respond with a FETCH_ERROR with
error code 'Invalid Range'.

The publisher receiving a Relative Joining Fetch computes the range as follows:

* Fetch Start Location: {Subscribe Largest Location.Group - Joining Start, 0}
* Fetch End Location: Subscribe Largest Location

A Fetch End Location.Object of 0 requests the entire group, but Fetch will not
retrieve Objects that have not yet been published, so 1 is subtracted from
the Fetch End Location.Group if Fetch End Location.Object is 0.

### Calculating the Range of an Absolute Joining Fetch

Identical to the Relative Joining fetch except that Fetch Start Location.Group
is the Joining Start value.


## FETCH_OK {#message-fetch-ok}

A publisher sends a FETCH_OK control message in response to successful fetches.
A publisher MAY send Objects in response to a FETCH before the FETCH_OK message is sent,
but the FETCH_OK MUST NOT be sent until the End Location is known.

~~~
FETCH_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x18,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Group Order (8),
  End Of Track (8),
  End Location (Location),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Subscribe Parameters (..) ...
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-ok format title="MOQT FETCH_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the FETCH this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Group Order: Indicates the fetch will be delivered in
Ascending (0x1) or Descending (0x2) order by group. See {{priorities}}.
Values of 0x0 and those larger than 0x2 are a protocol error.

* End Of Track: 1 if all Objects have been published on this Track, and
  the End Location is the final Object in the Track, 0 if not.

* End Location: The largest object covered by the FETCH response.
  The End Location is determined as follows:
   - If the requested FETCH End Location was beyond the Largest known (possibly
     final) Object, End Location is {Largest.Group, Largest.Object + 1}
   - If End Location.Object in the FETCH request was 0 and the response covers
     the last Object in the Group, End Location is {Fetch.End Location.Group, 0}
   - Otherwise, End Location is Fetch.End Location

  If the relay is subscribed to the track, it uses its knowledge of the largest
  {Group, Object} to set End Location.  If if is not subscribed and the
  requested End Location exceeds its cached data, the relay makes an upstream
  request to complete the FETCH, and uses the upstream response to set End
  Location.

  If End is smaller than the Start Location in the corresponding FETCH the
  receiver MUST close the session with `Protocol Violation`

* Subscribe Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## FETCH_ERROR {#message-fetch-error}

A publisher sends a FETCH_ERROR control message in response to a
failed FETCH.

~~~
FETCH_ERROR Message {
  Type (i) = 0x19,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-error format title="MOQT FETCH_ERROR Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the FETCH this message is replying to
  {{message-subscribe-req}}.

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for fetch failure.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for fetch error. See {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in FETCH_ERROR,
as defined below:

|------|------------------------------|
| Code | Reason                       |
|-----:|:-----------------------------|
| 0x0  | Internal Error               |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x1  | Unauthorized                 |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x2  | Timeout                      |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x3  | Not Supported                |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x4  | Track Does Not Exist         |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x5  | Invalid Range                |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x6  | No Objects                   |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x7  | Invalid Joining Request ID   |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x8  | Unknown Status in Range      |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x9  | Malformed Track              |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x10 | Malformed Auth Token         |
|------|------------------------------|
| 0x12 | Expired Auth Token           |
|------|------------------------------|

* Internal Error - An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

* Unauthorized - The subscriber is not authorized to fetch from the given
  track.

* Timeout - The fetch could not be completed before an implementation
  specific timeout.  For example, a relay could not FETCH missing objects
  within the timeout.

* Not supported - The endpoint does not support the FETCH method.

* Track Does Not Exist - The requested track is not available at the publisher.

* Invalid Range - The end of the requested range is earlier than the beginning,
  the start of the requested range is beyond the Largest Location, or the track
  has not published any Objects yet.

* No Objects - No Objects exist between the requested Start and End Locations.

* Invalid Joining Subscribe ID - The joining Fetch referenced a Request ID that
  did not belong to an active Subscription.

* Unknown Status in Range - The requested range contains objects with unknown
  status.

* Malformed Track - A relay publisher detected the track was malformed (see
  {{malformed-tracks}}).

* Malformed Auth Token - Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration
  (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Expired Auth Token - Authorization token has expired {{authorization-token}}).


## FETCH_CANCEL {#message-fetch-cancel}

A subscriber sends a FETCH_CANCEL message to a publisher to indicate it is no
longer interested in receiving objects for the fetch identified by the 'Request
ID'. The publisher SHOULD promptly close the unidirectional stream, even if it
is in the middle of delivering an object.

The format of `FETCH_CANCEL` is as follows:

~~~
FETCH_CANCEL Message {
  Type (i) = 0x17,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-fetch-cancel title="MOQT FETCH_CANCEL Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the FETCH ({{message-fetch}}) this message is
  cancelling.

## TRACK_STATUS {#message-track-status}

A potential subscriber sends a 'TRACK_STATUS' message on the control
stream to obtain information about the current status of a given track.

The TRACK_STATUS message format is identical to the SUBSCRIBE message
({{message-subscribe-req}}).

The receiver of a TRACK_STATUS message treats it identically as if it had
received a SUBSCRIBE message, except it does not create downstream subscription
state or send any Objects.  Relays without an active subscription MAY forward
TRACK_STATUS to one or more publishers, or MAY initiate a subscription (subject
to authorization) as described in {{publisher-interactions}} to determine the
response. The publisher does not send SUBSCRIBE_DONE for this request, and the
subscriber cannot send SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE or UNSUBSCRIBE.

## TRACK_STATUS_OK {#message-track-status-ok}

The publisher sends a TRACK_STATUS_OK control message in response
to a successful TRACK_STATUS message.

The TRACK_STATUS_OK message format is identical to the SUBSCRIBE_OK message
({{message-subscribe-ok}}).

The publisher populates the fields of TRACK_STATUS_OK exactly as it would have
populated a SUBSCRIBE_OK, setting Track Alias to 0. It is not considered an error
if Track Alias 0 is already in use by an active subscription.


## TRACK_STATUS_ERROR {#message-track-status-error}

The publisher sends a TRACK_STATUS_ERROR control message in response
to a failed TRACK_STATUS message.

The TRACK_STATUS_ERROR message format is identical to the SUBSCRIBE_ERROR
message ({{message-subscribe-error}}).

The publisher populates the fields of TRACK_STATUS_ERROR exactly as it would
have populated a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR.

## ANNOUNCE {#message-announce}

The publisher sends the ANNOUNCE control message to advertise that it has
tracks available within the announced Track Namespace. The receiver verifies the
publisher is authorized to publish tracks under this namespace.

~~~
ANNOUNCE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x6,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace (tuple),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-announce-format title="MOQT ANNOUNCE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
({{track-name}})

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

## ANNOUNCE_OK {#message-announce-ok}

The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_OK control message to acknowledge the
successful authorization and acceptance of an ANNOUNCE message.

~~~
ANNOUNCE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x7,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-announce-ok format title="MOQT ANNOUNCE_OK Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the ANNOUNCE this message is replying to
  {{message-announce}}.

## ANNOUNCE_ERROR {#message-announce-error}

The subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_ERROR control message for tracks that
failed authorization.

~~~
ANNOUNCE_ERROR Message {
  Type (i) = 0x8,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-announce-error format title="MOQT ANNOUNCE_ERROR Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the ANNOUNCE this message is replying to
  {{message-announce}}.

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for announcement failure.

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for announcement error. See {{reason-phrase}}.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in ANNOUNCE_ERROR, as defined
below:

|------|---------------------------|
| Code | Reason                    |
|-----:|:--------------------------|
| 0x0  | Internal Error            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x1  | Unauthorized              |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x2  | Timeout                   |

|------|---------------------------|
| 0x10 | Malformed Auth Token      |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x12 | Expired Auth Token        |
|------|---------------------------|

* Internal Error - An implementation specific or generic error occurred.

* Unauthorized - The subscriber is not authorized to announce the given
  namespace.

* Timeout - The announce could not be completed before an implementation
  specific timeout.

* Not Supported - The endpoint does not support the ANNOUNCE method.

* Uninterested - The namespace is not of interest to the endpoint.

* Malformed Auth Token - Invalid Auth Token serialization during registration
  (see {{authorization-token}}).

* Expired Auth Token - Authorization token has expired {{authorization-token}}).


## UNANNOUNCE {#message-unannounce}

The publisher sends the `UNANNOUNCE` control message to indicate
its intent to stop serving new subscriptions for tracks
within the provided Track Namespace.

~~~
UNANNOUNCE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x9,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace (tuple),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-unannounce-format title="MOQT UNANNOUNCE Message"}

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
({{track-name}}).

## ANNOUNCE_CANCEL {#message-announce-cancel}

The subscriber sends an `ANNOUNCE_CANCEL` control message to
indicate it will stop sending new subscriptions for tracks
within the provided Track Namespace.

~~~
ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message {
  Type (i) = 0xC,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace (tuple),
  Error Code (i),
  Error Reason (Reason Phrase),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-announce-cancel-format title="MOQT ANNOUNCE_CANCEL Message"}

* Track Namespace: Identifies a track's namespace as defined in
({{track-name}}).

* Error Code: Identifies an integer error code for canceling the announcement.
ANNOUNCE_CANCEL uses the same error codes as ANNOUNCE_ERROR
({{message-announce-error}}).

* Error Reason: Provides the reason for announcement cancelation. See {{reason-phrase}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE {#message-subscribe-ns}

The subscriber sends the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE control message to a publisher to
request the current set of matching announcements and established subscriptions,
as well as future updates to the set.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x11,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Track Namespace Prefix (tuple),
  Number of Parameters (i),
  Parameters (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-subscribe-ns-format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message"}

* Request ID: See {{request-id}}.

* Track Namespace Prefix: An ordered N-Tuple of byte fields which are matched
against track namespaces known to the publisher.  For example, if the publisher
is a relay that has received ANNOUNCE messages for namespaces ("example.com",
"meeting=123", "participant=100") and ("example.com", "meeting=123",
"participant=200"), a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE for ("example.com", "meeting=123")
would match both.  If an endpoint receives a Track Namespace Prefix tuple with
an N of 0 or more than 32, it MUST close the session with a Protocol
Violation.

* Parameters: The parameters are defined in {{version-specific-params}}.

The publisher will respond with SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK or
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR.  If the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE is successful, the
publisher will immediately forward existing ANNOUNCE and PUBLISH messages that
match the Track Namespace Prefix that have not already been sent to this
subscriber.  If the set of matching ANNOUNCE messages changes, the publisher
sends the corresponding ANNOUNCE or UNANNOUNCE message.

A subscriber cannot make overlapping namespace subscriptions on a single
session.  Within a session, if a publisher receives a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE with a
Track Namespace Prefix that is a prefix of, suffix of, or equal to an active
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE, it MUST respond with SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR, with error
code Namespace Prefix Overlap.

The publisher MUST ensure the subscriber is authorized to perform this
namespace subscription.

SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE is not required for a publisher to send ANNOUNCE, UNANNOUNCE
or PUBLISH messages to a subscriber.  It is useful in applications or relays
where subscribers are only interested in or authorized to access a subset of
available announcements and tracks.

## SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK {#message-sub-ns-ok}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK control message for successful
namespace subscriptions.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK Message {
  Type (i) = 0x12,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-sub-ann-ok format title="MOQT SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_OK
Message"}

* Request ID: The Request ID of the SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE this message is replying
  to {{message-subscribe-ns}}.

## SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR {#message-sub-ns-error}

A publisher sends a SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR control message in response to
a failed SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE.

~~~
SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE_ERROR Message {
  Type (i) = 0x13,
  Length (16),
  Request ID (i),
  Error Code (i),

## UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE {#message-unsub-ns}

A subscriber issues a `UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE` message to a publisher indicating
it is no longer interested in ANNOUNCE, UNANNOUNCE and PUBLISH messages for the
specified track namespace prefix.

The format of `UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE` is as follows:

~~~
UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message {
  Type (i) = 0x14,
  Length (16),
  Track Namespace Prefix (tuple)
}
~~~
{: #moq-transport-unsub-ann-format title="MOQT UNSUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE Message"}

* Track Namespace Prefix: As defined in {{message-subscribe-ns}}.


# Data Streams and Datagrams {#data-streams}

A publisher sends Objects matching a subscription on Data Streams or Datagrams.

All unidirectional MOQT streams start with a variable-length integer indicating
the type of the stream in question.

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ID          | Type                                            |
|------------:|:------------------------------------------------|
| 0x08-0x0D   | SUBGROUP_HEADER  ({{subgroup-header}})          |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 0x05        | FETCH_HEADER  ({{fetch-header}})                |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|

All MOQT datagrams start with a variable-length integer indicating the type of
the datagram.

|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ID        | Type                                              |
|----------:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00-0x03 | OBJECT_DATAGRAM ({{object-datagram}})             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0x04-0x05 | OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS ({{object-datagram}})      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|

An endpoint that receives an unknown stream or datagram type MUST close the
session.

The publisher only sends Objects after receiving a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH.  The
publisher MUST NOT send Objects that are not requested.  If an endpoint receives
an Object it never requested, it SHOULD terminate the session with a protocol
violation. Objects can arrive after a subscription or fetch has been cancelled,
so the session MUST NOT be teriminated in that case.

Every Track has a single 'Object Forwarding Preference' and the Original
Publisher MUST NOT mix different forwarding preferences within a single track
(see {{malformed-tracks}}).

## Track Alias

To optimize wire efficiency, Subgroups and Datagrams refer to a track by a
numeric identifier, rather than the Full Track Name.  Track Alias is chosen by
the publisher and included in SUBSCRIBE_OK ({{message-subscribe-ok}} or PUBLISH
({{message-publish}}).

## Objects {#message-object}

An Object contains a range of contiguous bytes from the
specified track, as well as associated metadata required to deliver,
cache, and forward it.  Objects are sent by publishers.

### Canonical Object Properties {#object-properties}

A canonical MoQ Object has the following information:

* Track Namespace and Track Name: The track this object belongs to.

* Group ID: The object is a member of the indicated group ID
{{model-group}} within the track.

* Object ID: The order of the object within the group.

* Publisher Priority: An 8 bit integer indicating the publisher's priority for
the Object {{priorities}}.

* Object Forwarding Preference: An enumeration indicating how a publisher sends
an object. The preferences are Subgroup and Datagram.  When in response to a
SUBSCRIBE, an Object MUST be sent according to its `Object Forwarding
Preference`, described below.

* Subgroup ID: The object is a member of the indicated subgroup ID ({{model-subgroup}})
within the group. This field is omitted if the Object Forwarding Preference is
Datagram.

* Object Status: As enumeration used to indicate missing
objects or mark the end of a group or track. See {{object-status}} below.

* Object Extension Length: The total length of the Object Extension Headers
  block, in bytes.

* Object Extensions : A sequence of Object Extension Headers. See
  {{object-extensions}} below.

* Object Payload: An opaque payload intended for an End Subscriber and SHOULD
NOT be processed by a relay. Only present when 'Object Status' is Normal (0x0).

#### Object Status {#object-status}

The Object Status informs subscribers what objects will not be received
because they were never produced, are no longer available, or because they
are beyond the end of a group or track.

`Status` can have following values:

* 0x0 := Normal object. This status is implicit for any non-zero length object.
         Zero-length objects explicitly encode the Normal status.

* 0x1 := Indicates Object does not exist. Indicates that this object
         does not exist at any publisher and it will not be published in
         the future. This SHOULD be cached.

* 0x3 := Indicates end of Group. ObjectId is one greater that the
         largest object produced in the group identified by the
         GroupID. This is sent right after the last object in the
         group. If the ObjectID is 0, it indicates there are no Objects
         in this Group. This SHOULD be cached. A publisher MAY use an end of
         Group object to signal the end of all open Subgroups in a Group. A
         non-zero-length Object can be the End of Group, as signaled in
         the DATAGRAM or SUBGROUP_HEADER Type field (see {{object-datagram}}
         and {{subgroup-header}}).

* 0x4 := Indicates end of Track. GroupID is either the largest group produced
         in this track and the ObjectID is one greater than the largest object
         produced in that group, or GroupID is one greater than the largest
         group produced in this track and the ObjectID is zero. This status
         also indicates the last group has ended. An object with this status
         that has a Group ID less than any other GroupID, or an ObjectID less
         than or equal to the largest in the specified group, is a protocol
         error, and the receiver MUST terminate the session. This SHOULD be
         cached.

Any other value SHOULD be treated as a protocol error and terminate the
session with a Protocol Violation ({{session-termination}}).
Any object with a status code other than zero MUST have an empty payload.

#### Object Extension Header {#object-extensions}
Any Object may have extension headers except those with Object Status 'Object
Does Not Exist'.  If an endpoint receives a non-existent Object containing
extension headers it MUST close the session with a Protocol Violation.

Object Extension Headers are visible to relays and allow the transmission of
future metadata relevant to MOQT Object distribution. Any Object metadata never
accessed by the transport or relays SHOULD be serialized as part of the Object
payload and not as an extension header.

Extension Headers are defined in external specifications and registered in an
IANA table {{iana}}. These specifications define the type and value of the
header, along with any rules concerning processing, modification, caching and
forwarding. A relay which is coded to implement these rules is said to
"support" the extension.

If unsupported by the relay, Extension Headers MUST NOT be modified, MUST be
cached as part of the Object and MUST be forwarded by relays.

If supported by the relay and subject to the processing rules specified in the
definition of the extension, Extension Headers MAY be modified, added, removed,
and/or cached by relays.

Object Extension Headers are serialized as Key-Value-Pairs (see
{{moq-key-value-pair}}).

Header types are registered in the IANA table 'MOQ Extension Headers'.
See {{iana}}.

## Datagrams

A single object can be conveyed in a datagram.  The Track Alias field
{{track-alias}} indicates the track this Datagram belongs to.  If an endpoint
receives a datagram with an unknown Track Alias, it MAY drop the datagram or
choose to buffer it for a brief period to handle reordering with the control
message that establishes the Track Alias.

An Object received in an `OBJECT_DATAGRAM` or `OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS` message
has an `Object Forwarding Preference` = `Datagram`.

To send an Object with `Object Forwarding Preference` = `Datagram`, determine
the length of the header and payload and send the Object as datagram.  When the
total size is larger than maximum datagram size for the session, the Object will
be dropped without any explicit notification.

Each session along the path between the Original Publisher and End Subscriber
might have different maximum datagram sizes. Additionally, Object Extension
Headers ({{object-extensions}}) can be added to Objects as they pass through
the MOQT network, increasing the size of the Object and the chances it will
exceed the maximum datagram size of a downstream session and be dropped.


### Object Datagram {#object-datagram}

An `OBJECT_DATAGRAM` carries a single object in a datagram.

~~~
OBJECT_DATAGRAM {
  Type (i) = 0x0-0x4,
  Track Alias (i),
  Group ID (i),
  Object ID (i),
  Publisher Priority (8),
  [Extension Headers Length (i),
  Extension headers (...)],
  Object Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #object-datagram-format title="MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM"}

There are 4 defined Type values for OBJECT_DATAGRAM:

|------|---------------|------------|
| Type | End Of Group  | Extensions |
|      |               | Present    |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 0x00 | No            | No         |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 0x01 | No            | Yes        |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 0x02 | Yes           | No         |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 0x03 | Yes           | Yes        |
|------|---------------|------------|

For Type values where End of Group is Yes, the Object is the last Object in the
Group.

For Type values where Extensions Present is No, Extensions Headers Length is not
present and the Object has no extensions.  When Extensions Present is Yes,
Extension Headers Length is present.  If an endpoint receives a datagram with
Type 0x01 and Extension Headers Length is 0, it MUST close the session with
Protocol Violation.

There is no explicit length field.  The entirety of the transport datagram
following Publisher Priority contains the Object Payload.

### Object Datagram Status {#object-datagram-status}

An `OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS` is similar to OBJECT_DATAGRAM except it
conveys an Object Status and has no payload.

~~~
OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS {
  Type (i),
  Track Alias (i),
  Group ID (i),
  Object ID (i),
  Publisher Priority (8),
  [Extension Headers Length (i),
  Extension headers (...)],
  Object Status (i),
}
~~~
{: #object-datagram-status-format title="MOQT OBJECT_DATAGRAM_STATUS"}

The Type field takes the form 0b0000001X (or the set of values from 0x02 to
0x03). The LSB of the type determines if the Extensions Headers Length and
Extension headers are present. If an endpoint receives a datagram with Type
0x03 and Extension Headers Length is 0, it MUST close the session with Protocol
Violation.

## Streams

When objects are sent on streams, the stream begins with a Subgroup Header
and is followed by one or more sets of serialized object fields.
If a stream ends gracefully in the middle of a serialized Object, the session
SHOULD be terminated with a Protocol Violation.

A publisher SHOULD NOT open more than one stream at a time with the same Subgroup
Header field values.

### Stream Cancellation

Streams aside from the control stream MAY be canceled due to congestion
or other reasons by either the publisher or subscriber. Early termination of a
stream does not affect the MoQ application state, and therefore has no
effect on outstanding subscriptions.

### Subgroup Header

All Objects on a Subgroup stream belong to the track identified by `Track Alias`
(see {{track-alias}}) and the Subgroup indicated by 'Group ID' and `Subgroup
ID` in the SUBGROUP_HEADER.

If an endpoint receives a subgroup with an unknown Track Alias, it MAY abandon
the stream, or choose to buffer it for a brief period to handle reordering with
the control message that establishes the Track Alias.  The endpoint MAY withhold
stream flow control beyond the SUBGROUP_HEADER until the Track Alias has been
established.  To prevent deadlocks, the publisher MUST allocate connection flow
control to the control stream before allocating it any data streams. Otherwise,
a receiver might wait for a control message containing a Track Alias to release
flow control, while the sender waits for flow control to send the message.

~~~
SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type (i) = 0x8..0xD,
  Track Alias (i),
  Group ID (i),
  [Subgroup ID (i),]
  Publisher Priority (8),
}
~~~
{: #object-header-format title="MOQT SUBGROUP_HEADER"}

All Objects received on a stream opened with `SUBGROUP_HEADER` have an
`Object Forwarding Preference` = `Subgroup`.

There are 12 defined Type values for SUBGROUP_HEADER:

|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Type | Subgroup ID   | Subgroup ID     | Extensions | Contains End |
|      | Field Present | Value           | Present    | of Group     |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x10 | No            | 0               | No         | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x11 | No            | 0               | Yes        | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x12 | No            | First Object ID | No         | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x13 | No            | First Object ID | Yes        | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x14 | Yes           | N/A             | No         | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x15 | Yes           | N/A             | Yes        | No           |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x18 | No            | 0               | No         | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x19 | No            | 0               | Yes        | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x1A | No            | First Object ID | No         | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x1B | No            | First Object ID | Yes        | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x1C | Yes           | N/A             | No         | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 0x1D | Yes           | N/A             | Yes        | Yes          |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|

For Type values where Contains End of Group is Yes, the last Object in this
Subgroup stream before a FIN is the last Object in the Group.  If the Subgroup
stream is terminated with a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT, the receiver cannot
determine the End of Group Object ID.

For Type values where Subgroup ID Field Present is No, there is no explicit
Subgroup ID field in the header and the Subgroup ID is either 0 (for Types
0x10-11 and 0x18-19) or the Object ID of the first object transmitted in this
subgroup (for Types 0x12-13 and 0x1A-1B).

For Type values where Extensions Present is No, Extensions Headers Length is
not present and all Objects have no extensions.  When Extensions Present is
Yes, Extension Headers Length is present in all Objects in this subgroup.
Objects with no extensions set Extension Headers Length to 0.

To send an Object with `Object Forwarding Preference` = `Subgroup`, find the open
stream that is associated with the subscription, `Group ID` and `Subgroup ID`,
or open a new one and send the `SUBGROUP_HEADER`. Then serialize the
following fields.

The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is zero.

~~~
{
  Object ID (i),
  [Extension Headers Length (i),
  Extension headers (...)],
  Object Payload Length (i),
  [Object Status (i)],
  Object Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #object-subgroup-format title="MOQT Subgroup Object Fields"}

A publisher MUST NOT send an Object on a stream if its Object ID is less than a
previously sent Object ID within a given group in that stream.

### Closing Subgroup Streams

Subscribers will often need to know if they have received all objects in a
Subgroup, particularly if they serve as a relay or cache. QUIC and Webtransport
streams provide signals that can be used for this purpose. Closing Subgroups
promptly frees system resources and often unlocks flow control credit to open
more streams.

If a sender has delivered all objects in a Subgroup to the QUIC stream, except
any Objects with Locations smaller than the subscription's Start Location, it
MUST close the stream with a FIN.

If a sender closes the stream before delivering all such objects to the QUIC
stream, it MUST use a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT
{{!I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset}} frame. This includes an open
Subgroup exceeding its Delivery Timeout, early termination of subscription due
to an UNSUBSCRIBE message, a publisher's decision to end the subscription early,
or a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE moving the subscription's End Group to a smaller Group or
the Start Location to a larger Location.  When RESET_STREAM_AT is used, the
reliable_size SHOULD include the stream header so the receiver can identify the
corresponding subscription and accurately account for reset data streams when
handling SUBSCRIBE_DONE (see {{message-subscribe-done}}).  Publishers that reset
data streams without using RESET_STREAM_AT with an appropriate reliable_size can
cause subscribers to hold on to subscription state until a timeout expires.

A sender might send all objects in a Subgroup and the FIN on a QUIC stream,
and then reset the stream. In this case, the receiving application would receive
the FIN if and only if all objects were received. If the application receives
all data on the stream and the FIN, it can ignore any RESET_STREAM it receives.

If a sender will not deliver any objects from a Subgroup, it MAY send
a SUBGROUP_HEADER on a new stream, with no objects, and then send RESET_STREAM_AT
with a reliable_size equal to the length of the stream header. This explicitly
tells the receiver there is an unsent Subgroup.

A relay MUST NOT forward an Object on an existing Subgroup stream unless it is
the next Object in that Subgroup.  A relay knows that an Object is the next
Object in the Subgroup if at least one of the following is true:
 * the Object ID is one greater than the previous Object sent on this Subgroup
   stream.
 * the Object was received on the same upstream Subgroup stream as the
   previously sent Object on the downstream Subgroup stream, with no other
   Objects in between.
 * it knows all Object IDs between the current and previous Object IDs
   on the Subgroup stream belong to different Subgroups or do not exist.

If the relay does not know if an Object is the next Object, it MUST reset the
Subgroup stream and open a new one to forward it.

Since SUBSCRIBEs always end on a group boundary, an ending subscription can
always cleanly close all its subgroups. A sender that terminates a stream
early for any other reason (e.g., to handoff to a different sender) MUST
use RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT. Senders SHOULD terminate a stream on
Group boundaries to avoid doing so.

An MOQT implementation that processes a stream FIN is assured it has received
all objects in a subgroup from the start of the subscription. If a relay, it
can forward stream FINs to its own subscribers once those objects have been
sent. A relay MAY treat receipt of EndOfGroup, GroupDoesNotExist, or
EndOfTrack objects as a signal to close corresponding streams even if the FIN
has not arrived, as further objects on the stream would be a protocol violation.

Similarly, an EndOfGroup message indicates the maximum Object ID in the
Group, so if all Objects in the Group have been received, a FIN can be sent on
any stream where the entire subgroup has been sent. This might be complex to
implement.

Processing a RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT means that there might be other
objects in the Subgroup beyond the last one received. A relay might immediately
reset the corresponding downstream stream, or it might attempt to recover the
missing Objects in an effort send all the objects in the subgroups and the FIN. It also
might send RESET_STREAM_AT with reliable_size set to the last object it has, so
as to reliably deliver the objects it has while signaling that other objects
might exist.

A subscriber MAY send a QUIC STOP_SENDING frame for a subgroup stream if the Group
or Subgroup is no longer of interest to it. The publisher SHOULD respond with
RESET_STREAM or RESET_STREAM_AT. If RESET_STREAM_AT is sent, note that the receiver
has indicated no interest in the objects, so setting a reliable_size beyond the
stream header is of questionable utility.

RESET_STREAM and STOP_SENDING on SUBSCRIBE data streams have no impact on other
Subgroups in the Group or the subscription, although applications might cancel all
Subgroups in a Group at once.

The application SHOULD use a relevant error code in RESET_STREAM or
RESET_STREAM_AT, as defined below:

|------|---------------------------|
| Code | Reason                    |
|-----:|:--------------------------|
| 0x0  | Internal Error            |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x1  | Cancelled                 |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x2  | Delivery Timeout          |
|------|---------------------------|
| 0x3  | Session Closed            |
|------|---------------------------|

Internal Error:

: An implementation specific error

Cancelled:

: The subscriber requested cancellation via UNSUBSCRIBE, FETCH_CANCEL or
STOP_SENDING, or the publisher ended the subscription, in which case
SUBSCRIBE_DONE ({{message-subscribe-done}}) will have a more detailed
status code.

Delivery Timeout:

: The DELIVERY TIMEOUT {{delivery-timeout}} was exceeded for this
stream

Session Closed:

: The publisher session is being closed

### Fetch Header {#fetch-header}

When a stream begins with `FETCH_HEADER`, all objects on the stream belong to the
track requested in the Fetch message identified by `Request ID`.

~~~
FETCH_HEADER {
  Type (i) = 0x5,
  Request ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fetch-header-format title="MOQT FETCH_HEADER"}


Each object sent on a fetch stream after the FETCH_HEADER has the following format:

~~~
{
  Group ID (i),
  Subgroup ID (i),
  Object ID (i),
  Publisher Priority (8),
  Extension Headers Length (i),
  [Extension headers (...)],
  Object Payload Length (i),
  [Object Status (i)],
  Object Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #object-fetch-format title="MOQT Fetch Object Fields"}

The Object Status field is only sent if the Object Payload Length is zero.

The Subgroup ID field of an object with a Forwarding Preference of "Datagram"
(see {{object-properties}}) is set to the Object ID.

## Examples

Sending a subgroup on one stream:

~~~
Stream = 2

SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type = 0
  Track Alias = 2
  Group ID = 0
  Subgroup ID = 0
  Publisher Priority = 0
}
{
  Object ID = 0
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "abcd"
}
{
  Object ID = 1
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "efgh"
}
~~~

Sending a group on one stream, with the first object containing two
Extension Headers.

~~~
Stream = 2

SUBGROUP_HEADER {
  Type = 1
  Track Alias = 2
  Group ID = 0
  Publisher Priority = 0
}
{
  Object ID = 0
  Extension Headers Length = 33
    { Type = 4
      Value = 2186796243
    },
    { Type = 77
      Length = 21
      Value = "traceID:123456"
    }
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "abcd"
}
{
  Object ID = 1
  Extension Headers Length = 0
  Object Payload Length = 4
  Payload = "efgh"
}

~~~

# Extension Headers

The following Object Extension Headers are defined in MOQT.

## Prior Group ID Gap

Prior Group ID Gap (Extension Header Type 0x40) is a variable length integer
containing the number of Groups prior to the current Group that do not and will
never exist. For example, if the Original Publisher published an Object in Group
7 and knows it will never publish any Objects in Group 8 or Group 9, it can
include Prior Group ID Gap = 2 in any number of Objects in Group 10, as it sees
fit.  A track with a Group that contains more than one Object with different
values for Prior Group ID Gap or has a Prior Group ID Gap larger than the Group
ID is considered malformed.  If an endpoint receives an Object with a Group ID
within a previously communicated gap it also treats the track as malformed
(see {{malformed-tracks}}.

This extension is optional, as publishers might not know the prior gap gize, or
there may not be a gap. If Prior Group ID Gap is not present, the receiver
cannot infer any information about the existence of prior groups (see
{{group-ordering}}).

This extension can be added by the Original Publisher, but MUST NOT be added by
relays. This extension MUST NOT be modified or removed.

# Security Considerations {#security}

TODO: Expand this section, including subscriptions.

## Resource Exhaustion

Live content requires significant bandwidth and resources.  Failure to
set limits will quickly cause resource exhaustion.

MOQT uses stream limits and flow control to impose resource limits at
the network layer.  Endpoints SHOULD set flow control limits based on the
anticipated bitrate.

Endpoints MAY impose a MAX STREAM count limit which would restrict the
number of concurrent streams which an application could have in
flight.

The publisher prioritizes and transmits streams out of order.  Streams
might be starved indefinitely during congestion.  The publisher and
subscriber MUST cancel a stream, preferably the lowest priority, after
reaching a resource limit.


## Timeouts

Implementations are advised to use timeouts to prevent resource
exhaustion attacks by a peer that does not send expected data within
an expected time.  Each implementation is expected to set its own limits.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

TODO: fill out currently missing registries:

* MOQT version numbers
* Setup parameters

The original design behind this protocol was inspired by three independent
proposals: WARP {{?I-D.draft-lcurley-warp}} by Luke Curley, RUSH
{{?I-D.draft-kpugin-rush}} by Kirill Pugin, Nitin Garg, Alan Frindell, Jordi
Cenzano and Jake Weissman, and QUICR {{?I-D.draft-jennings-moq-quicr-proto}} by
Cullen Jennings, Suhas Nandakumar and Christian Huitema.  The authors of those
documents merged their proposals to create the first draft of moq-transport.
The IETF MoQ Working Group received an enormous amount of support from many
people. The following people provided substantive contributions to this
document:

Issue and pull request numbers are listed with a leading octothorp.

## Since draft-ietf-moq-transport-11

* Move Track Alias from SUBSCRIBE to SUBSCRIBE_OK (#977)
* Expand cases FETCH_OK returns Invalid Range (#946) and clarify fields (#936)
* Add an error code to FETCH_ERROR when an Object status is unknown (#825)
* Rename Latest Object to Largest Object (#1024) and clarify what to
  do when it's incomplete (#937)
* Explain Malformed Tracks and what to do with them (#938)
* Allow End of Group to be indicated in a normal Object (#1011)
* Relays MUST have an upstream subscription to send SUBSCRIBE_OK (#1017)
* Allow AUTHORIZATION TOKEN in CLIENT_SETUP, SERVER_SETUP and
  other fixes (#1013)
* Add PUBLISH for publisher initiated subscriptions (#995) and
  fix the PUBLISH codepoints (#1048, #1051)

## Since draft-ietf-moq-transport-10

* Added Common Structure definitions - Location, Key-Value-Pair and Reason
  Phrase
* Limit lengths of all variable length fields, including Track Namespace and Name
* Control Message length is now 16 bits instead of variable length
* Subscribe ID became Request ID, and was added to most control messages. Request ID
  is used to correlate OK/ERROR responses for ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE,
  and TRACK_STATUS.  Like Subscribe ID, Request IDs are flow controlled.
* Explain rules for caching in more detail
* Changed the SETUP parameter format for even number parameters to match the
  Object Header Extension format
* Rotated SETUP code points
* Added Parameters to TRACK_STATUS and TRACK_STATUS_REQUEST
* Clarified how subscribe filters work
* Added Next Group Filter to SUBSCRIBE
* Added Forward flag to SUBSCRIBE
* Renamed FETCH_OK field to End and clarified how to set it
* Added Absolute Joining Fetch
* Clarified No Error vs Invalid Range FETCH_ERROR cases
* Use bits in SUBGROUP_HEADER and DATAGRAM* types to compress subgroup ID and
  extensions
* Coalesced END_OF_GROUP and END_OF_TRACK_AND_GROUP status
* Objects that Do Not Exist cannot have extensions when sent on the wire
* Specified error codes for resetting data streams
* Defined an Object Header Extension for communicating a known Group ID gap
* Replaced AUTHORIZATION_INFO with AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN, which has more structure,
  compression, and additional Auth related error codes (#760)
